# 🎯 Why Each Matters in ML

- **Dot products & norms** → similarity (cosine, Euclidean).
- **Matrix operations** → representation of data (features, weights).
- **Eigenvalues/SVD** → PCA, embeddings, dimensionality reduction.
- **Projections** → least squares, regression.
- **PSD matrices** → covariance in probabilistic models.
- **Matrix calculus** → backpropagation, optimization.
