# 🎲 Probability & Statistics for Machine Learning – Subtopics

---

## 1. Basics of Probability

* Probability definitions (sample space, events)
* Axioms of probability
* Conditional probability
* Independence of events
* Law of total probability
* Bayes’ theorem (very important for ML)

---

## 2. Random Variables

* Discrete vs. continuous random variables
* Probability Mass Function (PMF)
* Probability Density Function (PDF)
* Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
* Expectation, variance, standard deviation
* Covariance & correlation

---

## 3. Important Distributions

* **Discrete**:

  * Bernoulli, Binomial, Multinomial
  * Poisson
* **Continuous**:

  * Uniform
  * Gaussian (Normal distribution)
  * Exponential
  * Gamma, Beta
  * Chi-square, Student’s t-distribution

*(Gaussian & Multinomial are heavily used in ML)*

---

## 4. Joint & Conditional Distributions

* Joint probability distribution
* Marginal distribution
* Conditional distribution
* Chain rule of probability
* Independence vs. conditional independence

---

## 5. Functions of Random Variables

* Linear transformations (e.g., scaling, shifting)
* Law of the unconscious statistician (LOTUS)
* Sum of random variables
* Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

---

## 6. Bayesian Concepts

* Prior, likelihood, posterior
* Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
* Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation
* Bayesian inference basics
* Conjugate priors

---

## 7. Statistics for ML

* Sampling methods (random, stratified, bootstrapping)
* Estimators: bias, variance, consistency
* Confidence intervals
* Hypothesis testing (p-values, significance)
* t-test, chi-square test, ANOVA
* A/B testing

---

## 8. Information Theory

* Entropy & cross-entropy
* KL divergence
* Mutual information
* Applications in ML:

  * Loss functions (cross-entropy in classification)
  * Variational Inference (KL divergence)

---

## 9. Multivariate Probability

* Multivariate Gaussian distribution
* Covariance matrix
* Correlation matrix
* Conditional distributions of multivariate Gaussian
* Applications: PCA, embeddings, probabilistic models

---

## 10. Advanced ML-Related Topics

* Markov chains
* Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
* Expectation-Maximization (EM algorithm)
* Probabilistic Graphical Models (Bayesian networks, factor graphs)

---

# 🎯 Why This Matters in ML

* **Bayes’ theorem** → Naive Bayes, Bayesian inference.
* **Gaussian distribution** → assumptions in regression, PCA, LDA.
* **MLE & MAP** → parameter estimation in models.
* **Entropy & KL divergence** → loss functions in LLMs.
* **Multivariate Gaussians** → embeddings, covariance in high-dimensional data.
* **Hypothesis testing** → A/B testing in real-world ML systems.
