Perfect — if you want a **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) roadmap**, especially for senior-level MNC interviews, you’ll need to go **beyond just solving problems**. Companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and other MNCs expect not only problem-solving speed but also **clarity, optimization, and system-level thinking**.

Here’s a structured **DSA Roadmap** for you:

---

# 🛠️ Data Structures & Algorithms Roadmap

## 1. **Foundations (Week 1–2)**

Before diving into advanced problems:

- **Complexity Analysis**: Big-O, Big-Ω, Big-Θ, amortized analysis.
- **Math Basics**: Logarithms, combinatorics, probability, modular arithmetic.
- **Recursion & Backtracking**: Master recursion tree, memoization.

👉 _Without time/space complexity fluency, you won’t clear interviews._

---

## 2. **Core Data Structures (Weeks 3–6)**

Learn implementation + problem patterns:

- **Arrays & Strings**

  - Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Prefix/Suffix, Kadane’s Algo.

- **Hashing**

  - HashMap, HashSet, frequency maps, collision handling.

- **Linked List**

  - Reverse, Detect Cycle (Floyd’s), Merge, Intersection.

- **Stacks & Queues**

  - Next Greater Element, Min Stack, Monotonic Stack/Queue.

- **Trees**

  - Traversals (DFS, BFS, Iterative), Lowest Common Ancestor, Diameter.

- **Binary Search Trees (BST)**

  - Insert/Delete/Search, Validate BST, Range Queries.

👉 _Practice \~5–7 problems per topic from LeetCode/InterviewBit._

---

## 3. **Advanced Data Structures (Weeks 7–10)**

- **Heaps & Priority Queues**

  - K largest/smallest, Median Finder, Top-K problems.

- **Graphs**

  - BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall.
  - Union-Find (Disjoint Set), Kruskal, Prim’s MST.
  - Topological Sort, Strongly Connected Components (Kosaraju, Tarjan).

- **Tries**

  - Word Search, Autocomplete, Prefix Matching.

- **Segment Trees / Fenwick Trees**

  - Range queries (sum, min, max), lazy propagation.

👉 _These separate mid-level engineers from seniors._

---

## 4. **Algorithms & Patterns (Weeks 11–14)**

- **Sorting & Searching**

  - QuickSort, MergeSort, Counting Sort, Binary Search patterns.

- **Greedy**

  - Interval Scheduling, Huffman Coding, Activity Selection.

- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**

  - 1D DP (Fibonacci, Coin Change).
  - 2D DP (LCS, Knapsack, Matrix Paths).
  - DP on Trees, DP with Bitmasking.

- **Graph Algorithms**

  - Shortest Path, Network Flow (Ford-Fulkerson), Bipartite Matching.

- **Divide & Conquer**

  - Matrix Multiplication, Search in Rotated Array, Majority Element.

👉 _DP + Graphs = the hardest but most rewarding sections._

---

## 5. **System-Oriented Algorithms (Senior Level Edge)**

Since you’re aiming **senior-level roles**, add:

- **Concurrency Patterns** (producer-consumer, deadlock detection).
- **External Sorting / Big Data Structures** (handling >RAM size).
- **Cache-Friendly Algorithms** (LRU cache, Bloom filters).
- **String Matching** (KMP, Rabin-Karp, Z-algorithm).

👉 _These come up in design-heavy AI/data interviews._

---

## 6. **Problem-Solving Strategy**

- **Phase 1**: Easy → Medium (100–150 problems).
- **Phase 2**: Medium → Hard (150–200 problems).
- **Phase 3**: Timed mocks (simulate interview).

👉 _Platform Mix_:

- **LeetCode** → most relevant to MNCs.
- **InterviewBit / GeeksforGeeks** → theory + practice.
- **Codeforces / AtCoder** → competitive speed & optimization.

---

## 7. **Interview Readiness**

- Be able to **explain your approach before coding**.
- Write **clean, modular code** (no messy brute force).
- Always give **time/space complexity trade-offs**.
- Be ready for **follow-up optimizations** (e.g., can you do it in O(n log n) instead of O(n²)?).

---

## 8. **Timeline (6-Month Plan)**

- **Month 1**: Basics + Arrays, Strings, Recursion.
- **Month 2**: Linked List, Stack, Queue, Hashing.
- **Month 3**: Trees + BST + Heaps.
- **Month 4**: Graphs + Tries.
- **Month 5**: DP + Greedy + Advanced.
- **Month 6**: System-level + mock interviews.

---

🔥 **Final Goal**: By the end, you should be able to:

- Solve **any unseen problem** within 30–40 mins.
- Explain trade-offs like a senior engineer.
- Apply DSA knowledge in **system design + AI/ML pipelines** (where efficiency matters at scale).
