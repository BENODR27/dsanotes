Got it üëç ‚Äî you want a **clear roadmap to prepare for a high-paying AI role in an MNC at a senior level**. Since you're aiming for a **senior + high salary position**, the expectation is not just coding or ML, but also **system design, applied expertise, leadership, and strategy**.

Here‚Äôs a structured roadmap for you:

---

# üöÄ Roadmap to a Senior AI Job in MNC (High Salary)

## 1. **Foundational Refresh (if needed)**

Even as a senior, companies will test your basics. Make sure you‚Äôre strong in:

- **Math for AI**: Linear Algebra, Probability, Statistics, Optimization.
- **Programming**: Python (NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch/TensorFlow, Scikit-learn).
- **CS Fundamentals**: Data Structures, Algorithms, OOP, Design Patterns.

üëâ _Why_: Even seniors are grilled on fundamentals in FAANG/MNC-style interviews.

---

## 2. **Core AI/ML Skills**

Deep expertise in modern AI is critical:

- **Machine Learning**: Regression, Classification, Clustering, Ensemble methods (XGBoost, Random Forest).
- **Deep Learning**:

  - Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, Attention.
  - Transformers (BERT, GPT, Vision Transformers).

- **MLOps**: Model deployment, scaling, monitoring (MLflow, Kubeflow, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP/Azure).
- **Data Handling**: SQL, Spark, BigQuery, data pipelines.

üëâ _Why_: MNCs expect you to build, deploy, and scale AI systems, not just train models in a notebook.

---

## 3. **Specialization (Pick 1‚Äì2 to stand out)**

Senior hires are valued for **depth**. Depending on interest & market demand:

- **Generative AI / LLMs**: Fine-tuning, prompt engineering, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
- **Computer Vision**: Detection, segmentation, video analysis.
- **AI in Domain**: Finance, Healthcare, Retail, Supply Chain, etc.
- **AI Engineering**: MLOps, large-scale systems, AI infrastructure.

üëâ _Tip_: High-paying roles prefer candidates with niche + leadership capability.

---

## 4. **System Design for AI**

This is where seniors differentiate.

- **Design large-scale ML systems** (recommendation engines, fraud detection, personalization).
- Knowledge of **distributed training** (Horovod, DeepSpeed).
- **Data pipelines** and **real-time inference** design.

üëâ _Companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft will ask "How would you design a large-scale recommendation system for 1B users?"_

---

## 5. **Leadership & Business Acumen**

At senior levels, you‚Äôll be judged not just on coding but:

- **Leading Teams**: mentoring, reviewing, managing AI projects.
- **AI Strategy**: understanding ROI, scaling, ethical AI practices.
- **Communication**: explaining AI to non-tech stakeholders.

üëâ _This is what differentiates a 25 LPA engineer from a 60‚Äì80 LPA senior._

---

## 6. **Interview Prep (Target MNCs)**

- **Leetcode / DSA**: Practice 100‚Äì150 medium/hard problems.
- **System Design (General + ML-specific)**: Read "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" + ML system design guides.
- **AI Case Studies**: Prepare 2‚Äì3 projects where you drove business impact with AI.
- **Behavioral (STAR method)**: MNCs heavily test leadership principles & culture fit.

---

## 7. **Portfolio & Visibility**

- Contribute to **open-source AI projects**.
- Publish **tech blogs / LinkedIn posts / GitHub repos**.
- Present **case studies with business impact** (not just Kaggle models).

---

## 8. **Networking & Target Companies**

- Build connections with hiring managers/recruiters on LinkedIn.
- Attend **AI conferences / meetups** (NeurIPS, CVPR, MLOps World).
- Shortlist target MNCs: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, OpenAI, Meta, plus consulting giants (Deloitte, Accenture AI).

---

# ‚è≥ Timeline (Fast-Track Senior Role)

- **0‚Äì3 months**: Refresh ML + DSA, build 1 end-to-end AI project with deployment.
- **3‚Äì6 months**: Specialize (LLMs / Vision / MLOps) + system design.
- **6‚Äì9 months**: Mock interviews, networking, publish projects.
- **9‚Äì12 months**: Target MNC interviews + negotiate offers.

---

‚úÖ **End Goal**: Position yourself as **not just an ML engineer, but an AI leader who can design, deploy, and scale AI systems for business impact**.

---

Would you like me to **map this into a personalized roadmap (step-by-step courses, projects, and timelines)** so you can follow it like a checklist?
