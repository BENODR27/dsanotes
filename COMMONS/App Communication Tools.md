Excellent ‚Äî you‚Äôre thinking like a real **software engineer** now üí™

Let‚Äôs look at a list of **popular communication technologies** that professional **Software Development Engineers (SDEs)** use ‚Äî including **gRPC** and **WebSockets**, and what each one is used for.

## üß© Categories of App Communication Tools

There are **3 main kinds** of communication between apps/services:

1. **Request/Response APIs** ‚Äî ‚ÄúAsk for something, get an answer‚Äù
2. **Streaming/Real-time connections** ‚Äî ‚ÄúKeep talking as long as we‚Äôre connected‚Äù
3. **Message queues & event systems** ‚Äî ‚ÄúSend a message and forget ‚Äî it‚Äôll get there eventually‚Äù

## üöÄ 1. Request/Response APIs (like gRPC)

These are used when one service **calls another**, like saying ‚ÄúHey, give me user data.‚Äù

| Tool / Protocol        | Description                                                  | Common Use                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **gRPC**               | High-performance binary RPC framework using Protocol Buffers | Microservices, backend-to-backend |
| **REST / HTTP APIs**   | The most common web API (JSON over HTTP)                     | Web/mobile apps                   |
| **GraphQL**            | Lets clients request _exactly_ the data they want            | Modern web/mobile APIs            |
| **Thrift** (by Apache) | Similar to gRPC, older but still used in large companies     | Distributed systems               |
| **SOAP**               | XML-based (old enterprise style)                             | Legacy enterprise apps            |

üß† _Used by_: Google, Netflix, Dropbox, Square, and many backend microservice teams

## ‚ö° 2. Real-Time / Streaming Connections (like WebSocket)

Used when you need **continuous, live updates** between client and server ‚Äî no waiting.

| Tool / Protocol              | Description                                 | Common Use                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **WebSocket**                | Persistent two-way connection               | Chats, games, live dashboards           |
| **Socket.IO**                | Library built on WebSocket + fallbacks      | Realtime web apps                       |
| **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** | One-way server ‚Üí client streaming over HTTP | Notifications, logs, live data feeds    |
| **WebRTC**                   | Peer-to-peer real-time audio/video/data     | Video calls, file sharing               |
| **MQTT**                     | Lightweight publish/subscribe protocol      | IoT devices, sensors                    |
| **gRPC streaming**           | gRPC mode that allows streams               | Microservices streaming data internally |

üß† _Used by_: Slack, Zoom, Discord, Binance, TradingView, Tesla IoT

## üì¶ 3. Message Queues & Event Systems

Used when apps want to **send messages asynchronously** ‚Äî ‚Äúfire and forget‚Äù.

| Tool / Protocol   | Description                                  | Common Use                 |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Kafka**         | Distributed event streaming platform         | Big data, logs, analytics  |
| **RabbitMQ**      | Message broker supporting multiple protocols | Task queues, backend jobs  |
| **Redis Pub/Sub** | In-memory message passing                    | Realtime updates           |
| **NATS**          | Lightweight messaging system                 | Cloud-native microservices |
| **AWS SQS / SNS** | Managed message and notification services    | Cloud event systems        |

üß† _Used by_: Uber, Airbnb, Netflix, Twitter, Meta, AWS

## üß≠ Choosing Which to Use

| Goal                                       | Best Choice                |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Fast structured API calls between services | **gRPC**                   |
| Public web API                             | **REST / GraphQL**         |
| Live chat / realtime dashboard             | **WebSocket / Socket.IO**  |
| Video or audio calls                       | **WebRTC**                 |
| IoT devices or sensors                     | **MQTT**                   |
| Background jobs or async processing        | **Kafka / RabbitMQ / SQS** |
