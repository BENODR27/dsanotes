Excellent question 👏 — this shows you’re thinking like a **senior engineer** who wants to automate setup and follow **standardized project structure**, just like `sequelize-cli` does for Node.js.

✅ **Short answer:**
Go doesn’t have an *official* CLI like Sequelize CLI that scaffolds an entire app for you — because Go culture values explicit architecture — **but there are professional-grade tools** and **templates** that achieve exactly what you’re asking for.

Let’s break it down.

---

## 🧩 1. There’s no *official* “Go CLI” like Sequelize CLI

Go itself is minimal — it doesn’t generate folders or boilerplates automatically (except `go mod init`).
But, there are **community tools** and **starter kits** used by senior developers to generate structured projects.

---

## ⚙️ 2. Top “Project Generator / Scaffolding” Tools for Go

### 🧰 **1. Cobra CLI (for command-line apps & scaffolding)**

* Officially supported by the Go ecosystem.
* Used by Kubernetes, Docker, and Hugo.
* You can use it to generate subcommands and folder structure.

#### Example:

```bash
go install github.com/spf13/cobra-cli@latest
```

Initialize a project:

```bash
cobra-cli init myapp
cd myapp
cobra-cli add serve
cobra-cli add migrate
```

📂 Folder created:

```
myapp/
├── cmd/
│   ├── root.go
│   ├── serve.go
│   └── migrate.go
├── main.go
└── go.mod
```

This is great for CLI tools and microservices command runners — similar to Sequelize’s `sequelize db:migrate`.

### 🧰 **2. Buffalo — “Rails for Go”**

> [https://gobuffalo.io/](https://gobuffalo.io/)

**Closest equivalent to Sequelize CLI in spirit.**
Buffalo generates **a full web project** (MVC-style) with **database migrations, ORM (Pop), and CLI** tools.

#### Install:

```bash
go install github.com/gobuffalo/cli/cmd/buffalo@latest
```

#### Create app:

```bash
buffalo new urlshortener
cd urlshortener
buffalo dev
```

📂 Folder structure:

```
urlshortener/
├── actions/        # controllers
├── models/         # ORM (Pop)
├── migrations/     # SQL migrations
├── templates/      # views (optional)
├── public/         # static
├── grifts/         # task runner (like npm scripts)
├── database.yml
└── config/
```

Buffalo even includes:

* Built-in hot reloading (`buffalo dev`)
* ORM via **Pop**
* Built-in migration CLI (`buffalo pop`)
* Integrated testing and env management

This is **most similar to Sequelize CLI + Express** in Go.

---

### 🧰 **3. Go Clean Architecture / Starter Generators**

If you prefer modern **Gin / Echo / Fiber APIs** (like our URL shortener), use:

* [`golang-standards/project-layout`](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)
* [`go-clean-template`](https://github.com/evrone/go-clean-template)
* [`goxygen`](https://github.com/Shpota/goxygen) — full-stack generator (Go backend + React/Vue frontend)

Example with `goxygen`:

```bash
go install github.com/Shpota/goxygen@latest
goxygen --frontend react --output myapp
```

📂 Generates:

```
myapp/
├── server/       # Go backend (Gin)
├── webapp/       # React app
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
```

## 🧱 3. “Professional Setup” for Go Developers

Professionals often combine tools like this:

| Layer         | Tool                                | Purpose                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Web Framework | **Gin**, **Echo**, **Fiber**        | REST API               |
| ORM           | **GORM**, **Ent**, or **SQLBoiler** | DB models + migrations |
| Config        | **Viper**, **envconfig**            | Config per environment |
| CLI           | **Cobra**, **urfave/cli**           | Command management     |
| Scaffolding   | **Buffalo** or **Clean Template**   | Folder & codegen       |
| Docs          | **Swaggo**                          | Swagger generation     |
| Testing       | **Testify**, **Ginkgo**             | Unit/integration tests |

## 🧠 4. Senior Engineering Tip — “Create Your Own CLI”

Many senior Go teams create their own internal **CLI tool** to scaffold projects:

For example, `company-cli new service user-api` might generate:

```
internal/
│── handler/
│── service/
│── repository/
pkg/
│── logger/
│── config/
cmd/
│── server/
```

You can build this easily with **Cobra CLI**, and it’s a great learning project!

---

## 🧩 5. Suggested Path for You

If you want a **professional API starter** like Sequelize CLI gives Node.js:
👉 Use this combo:

1. **`go-clean-template`** (for structure + Docker + CI)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/evrone/go-clean-template.git myapp
   ```
2. **Add GORM** for ORM/migrations
3. **Add Viper** for environment configs
4. **Use Cobra** to add commands like `migrate`, `seed`, `serve`

This gives you a *professional-grade base*, with clean architecture and everything already set up.

Would you like me to **generate a ready-to-use Go project scaffolding CLI** (like Sequelize CLI), that you can install and run like:

```bash
go run github.com/yourname/gocli new myapp
```

It would:

* Create folders (cmd, internal, pkg)
* Add main.go with Gin
* Initialize go.mod and Dockerfile
* Optionally set up GORM and config loader

I can generate the code for that CLI right here. Want me to?
