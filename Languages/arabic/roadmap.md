Perfect 👍 Let’s make a **4-month roadmap for learning Arabic** as a professional (comparing with English, just like we did for Finnish).

⚠️ Important: Arabic has **two layers**:

1. **Modern Standard Arabic (MSA / فصحى fuṣḥā)** → formal, used in news, documents, pan-Arab communication.
2. **Dialects (عامية ʿāmmiyya)** → everyday speech (Egyptian, Levantine, Gulf, Maghrebi, etc.).

👉 Since you want it for **professional use**, I’ll focus on **MSA** (for formal writing/reading) + give you tips for picking up **a dialect** for speaking.
