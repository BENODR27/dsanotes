PM2 is a popular process manager for Node.js applications that helps ensure continuous application execution, load balancing, and process monitoring.Here's a professional guide on how to use PM2 for managing your Node.js application:

### 1. ** Installation **
    First, you need to install PM2 globally on your system.

   ```bash
   npm install pm2 -g
   ```

   This allows you to access PM2 commands globally.

### 2. ** Starting the Application **
    To start your Node.js application with PM2, simply use:

    ```bash
   pm2 start app.js --name myapp
   ```

        - `app.js`: Your main application file.
   - `--name myapp`: This specifies a custom name for your application(optional).

### 3. ** Process Management **
    PM2 allows you to easily manage multiple processes.

   - To list running processes:

```bash
     pm2 list
     ```

    - To stop a process:

```bash
     pm2 stop myapp
     ```

    - To restart a process:

```bash
     pm2 restart myapp
     ```

    - To delete a process:

```bash
     pm2 delete myapp
     ```

### 4. ** Load Balancing **
    PM2 provides load balancing through its cluster mode, which allows your app to take full advantage of multi - core systems.

   - To start your app in cluster mode:

```bash
     pm2 start app.js -i max
     ```

The `-i max` flag starts as many instances as the number of available CPU cores.

### 5. ** Process Monitoring **
    PM2 provides an intuitive monitoring interface where you can view CPU and memory usage of all processes in real - time.

   - To view logs:

```bash
     pm2 logs
     ```

    - To monitor the application:

```bash
     pm2 monit
     ```

     This shows a real - time dashboard with application performance stats.

### 6. ** Managing Environment Variables **
    You can pass environment variables to your Node.js application using PM2.

```bash
   pm2 start app.js --env production
   ```

   You can define different environments in your`ecosystem.config.js` file for better configuration management.

### 7. ** PM2 Ecosystem File **
    The ecosystem file is a powerful tool for managing your application configuration, including environment variables, instances, and script execution options.

   - Create an `ecosystem.config.js`:

```javascript
     module.exports = {
       apps: [{
         name: 'myapp',
         script: 'app.js',
         instances: 'max',
         exec_mode: 'cluster',
         env: {
           NODE_ENV: 'development'
         },
         env_production: {
           NODE_ENV: 'production'
         }
       }]
     };
     ```

    - Start your application using the ecosystem file:

        ```bash
     pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production
     ```

### 8. ** Persistent Process with PM2 **
PM2 ensures your application is automatically restarted on system reboots.

   - To enable PM2 startup on system boot:

```bash
     pm2 startup
     ```

    - Save the current process list so it can be restored after a reboot:

```bash
     pm2 save
     ```

### 9. ** Logs Management **
    PM2 manages logs for both output and error logs, storing them in log files for easier debugging.

   - To view logs for a specific application:

    ```bash
     pm2 logs myapp
     ```

        - To clear all logs:

```bash
     pm2 flush
     ```

### 10. ** Auto Restarting on Crashes **
    PM2 will automatically restart your application if it crashes, which ensures continuous uptime.

### 11. ** Backup and Restore PM2 Process List **
    If you need to back up your PM2 process list and restore it later:

- Backup:

```bash
     pm2 dump
     ```

    - Restore:

```bash
     pm2 resurrect
     ```

### 12. ** Scaling Your Application **
    PM2 allows you to scale your application dynamically, adjusting the number of instances based on load.

   - Scale your app to a specific number of instances:

```bash
     pm2 scale myapp 4
     ```

   This command will scale your app to 4 instances.

### 13. ** Monitoring with Keymetrics **
PM2 offers integration with Keymetrics, a real - time monitoring platform, which provides more detailed metrics and insights into your app's performance.

   To enable Keymetrics integration:

- First, sign up at[Keymetrics](https://keymetrics.io).
    - Use the following command to link your app:

    ```bash
     pm2 link <public-key> <private-key>
     ```

    By incorporating PM2 into your Node.js deployment process, you ensure that your application is always running efficiently with built -in features for process management, monitoring, and scaling.This is essential for production environments where high availability and fault tolerance are critical.
