Got it 🚀 — you want a **1-week intensive roadmap** to become proficient in Rust. Rust is a deep language, but I’ll give you a structured **day-by-day plan** that covers **all essential topics**, so by the end of 7 days you’ll have a solid foundation and can start building real-world projects.

---

# 🦀 7-Day Roadmap to Rust Proficiency

## **Day 1 – Foundations**

- Install Rust (`rustup`, `cargo`)
- Learn how `cargo new`, `cargo build`, `cargo run`, and `cargo test` work
- Basic syntax:

  - Variables (`let`, `mut`, `const`)
  - Data types (integers, floats, bool, char, tuples, arrays)
  - Functions & expressions

- Control flow (`if`, `loop`, `while`, `for`)

**Mini project**: Write a number guessing game (from _Rust Book_).

---

## **Day 2 – Ownership & Borrowing (The Heart of Rust)**

- Ownership rules
- Borrowing (`&`, `&mut`)
- Slices
- Lifetimes (intro only)

**Mini project**: Function that finds the largest number in a list using references.

---

## **Day 3 – Structs, Enums, and Pattern Matching**

- Structs (`struct`, `impl`)
- Enums & `Option`, `Result`
- Pattern matching with `match`, `if let`, `while let`
- Associated functions & methods
- `derive` traits like `Debug`, `Clone`, `PartialEq`

**Mini project**: Build a CLI todo app with enums for task states.

---

## **Day 4 – Collections & Error Handling**

- Vectors, Strings, HashMap
- Error handling:

  - `Result<T, E>`
  - `?` operator
  - Custom error types

- Modules & `use`

**Mini project**: Word counter CLI app with `HashMap`.

---

## **Day 5 – Generics, Traits, and Advanced Types**

- Generics (`<T>`)
- Traits (`trait`, `impl`, default methods)
- Trait bounds
- Lifetimes (deeper dive)
- Smart pointers (`Box`, `Rc`, `Arc`, `RefCell`)

**Mini project**: Implement a generic `Point<T>` struct with trait bounds.

---

## **Day 6 – Concurrency & Asynchronous Rust**

- Threads (`std::thread`)
- Channels (`std::sync::mpsc`)
- `Send` and `Sync`
- Async/await, `tokio` runtime
- Futures & streams

**Mini project**: Write a multi-threaded program that sums numbers in parallel.

---

## **Day 7 – Ecosystem, Testing, and Project**

- Cargo ecosystem (crates.io, dependencies)
- Unit tests & integration tests
- Documentation (`///`, `cargo doc`)
- Benchmarking (`criterion`)
- Build a small real-world project (examples below)

**Mini project options**:

- REST API with `actix-web` or `axum`
- CLI tool with `clap`
- Simple web scraper with `reqwest` + `tokio`

⚡ By the end of the week, you won’t “master” Rust (that takes months), but you **will** be production-ready enough to build real apps and keep growing through projects.

👉 Do you want me to also create a **daily study schedule with hours (like 4–6 hours/day)** so you know exactly what to do each session?
