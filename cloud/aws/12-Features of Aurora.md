## 🧭 1. High Performance & Scalability

| Feature                         | Description                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **MySQL/PostgreSQL compatible** | Run apps without rewriting SQL code              |
| **High throughput**             | 5× MySQL, 3× PostgreSQL performance improvements |
| **Aurora Replicas**             | Up to 15 replicas per cluster for read scaling   |
| **Auto-scaling storage**        | 10 GB → 64 TB, automatically grows with data     |
| **Reader endpoint**             | Load balances read queries across replicas       |

## ⚡ 2. High Availability & Durability

| Feature                        | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multi-AZ replication**       | Storage replicated across 3 AZs                                           |
| **Self-healing storage**       | Detects and repairs disk failures automatically                           |
| **Automatic failover**         | Writer instance fails → Aurora replica promoted in <30 sec                |
| **Backups & PITR**             | Continuous backups to S3 with point-in-time recovery                      |
| **Replication across regions** | Aurora Global Database for disaster recovery and low-latency global reads |

I can also make a **diagram showing all Aurora features in one view** — including **writer, replicas, multi-AZ, global DB, security, and monitoring** — which is extremely useful for **SAP-C02 exam prep**.

Do you want me to create that diagram?
