# üßä **Amazon S3 Glacier Vault Lock**

---

## üß† **What Is S3 Glacier Vault Lock?**

**S3 Glacier Vault Lock** is a **compliance and governance feature** that lets you **enforce write-once-read-many (WORM)** data protection on archives stored in **Amazon S3 Glacier** (and Glacier Deep Archive).

It helps organizations **meet regulatory requirements** ‚Äî for example, **SEC 17a-4(f)**, **FINRA**, **HIPAA**, and **GDPR** ‚Äî by preventing any user, including root, from deleting or modifying data before a defined retention period expires.

---

## üß© **Key Concept: ‚ÄúVaults‚Äù in Glacier**

Unlike S3 buckets, in **Amazon S3 Glacier (the original service)**:

* Data is stored in **Vaults**.
* Each vault can contain many **archives** (individual data files).
* Vaults have **Vault Access Policies** and **Vault Lock Policies**.

---

## üß± **Difference Between S3 Object Lock vs Glacier Vault Lock**

| Feature          | **S3 Object Lock**                      | **S3 Glacier Vault Lock**   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Applies to       | S3 buckets / objects                    | Glacier vaults              |
| Retention Type   | Object-level                            | Vault-level                 |
| Lock Enforcement | Versioning + WORM                       | Vault Policy WORM           |
| Common Use Case  | S3 (standard, infrequent, deep archive) | Glacier archives directly   |
| Supported via    | S3 console / API                        | Glacier console / CLI / API |

‚úÖ **If you‚Äôre using ‚ÄúS3 Glacier Storage Class‚Äù inside S3 ‚Üí use S3 Object Lock.**
‚úÖ **If you‚Äôre using ‚ÄúGlacier Vaults‚Äù directly ‚Üí use Glacier Vault Lock.**

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How Glacier Vault Lock Works**

There are **two phases** to setting up a Vault Lock:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Initiate Lock**

* You create a **Vault Lock Policy** and start the lock process.
* During this time, you can **test and modify** the policy.
* Vault enters **‚ÄúIn Progress‚Äù** state.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Complete Lock**

* When satisfied, you **complete** the Vault Lock.
* Vault enters **‚ÄúLocked‚Äù** state.
* After this, **policy is immutable forever** ‚Äî no one (even AWS Support) can remove it.

---

## üîê **Example Vault Lock Policy (JSON)**

Here‚Äôs a policy that **prevents deleting archives for 1 year (365 days)**:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "ComplianceRetentionPolicy",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "glacier:DeleteArchive",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:glacier:us-east-1:123456789012:vaults/my-compliance-vault",
      "Condition": {
        "NumericLessThan": {
          "glacier:ArchiveAgeInDays": 365
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

üß© **Explanation:**

* `DeleteArchive` is denied if the archive age is less than **365 days**.
* Ensures files can‚Äôt be deleted or replaced within the retention period.

## üíª **Creating a Vault Lock ‚Äì Step by Step**

### **Step 1: Create a Vault**

```bash
aws glacier create-vault --account-id - --vault-name my-compliance-vault
```

---

### **Step 2: Prepare Your Policy**

Save the JSON above as `vault-lock-policy.json`.

---

### **Step 3: Initiate Vault Lock**

```bash
aws glacier initiate-vault-lock \
    --account-id - \
    --vault-name my-compliance-vault \
    --policy file://vault-lock-policy.json
```

‚úÖ Output includes a **LockId**.

---

### **Step 4: Validate Policy (Optional)**

During ‚ÄúIn Progress‚Äù state, you can test by uploading/deleting archives to confirm it works as intended.

---

### **Step 5: Complete Vault Lock**

Once verified, **finalize** the lock:

```bash
aws glacier complete-vault-lock \
    --account-id - \
    --vault-name my-compliance-vault \
    --lock-id <LockId>
```

After this:

* Policy becomes **immutable**.
* Vault enters **Locked** state.
* Even the **root account** cannot delete or change the policy.

---

### **Step 6: Verify Vault Lock Status**

```bash
aws glacier describe-vault --account-id - --vault-name my-compliance-vault
```

You‚Äôll see output like:

```json
{
  "VaultName": "my-compliance-vault",
  "VaultLockPolicy": {
    "State": "Locked"
  }
}
```

## üßæ **Key Policy Conditions**

| Condition Key                     | Description                    |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `glacier:ArchiveAgeInDays`        | Age of archive in days         |
| `glacier:ResourceTag/<tag>`       | Restrict based on tags         |
| `NumericLessThan`, `DateLessThan` | Used to define retention rules |

---

## üß† **Use Cases**

| Use Case                  | Description                                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Regulatory compliance** | Financial, healthcare, or government data requiring WORM   |
| **Immutable backups**     | Prevents accidental or malicious deletion of archived data |
| **Audit & forensics**     | Guarantees data integrity over long periods                |
| **Disaster recovery**     | Ensures retention of critical logs or evidence             |

---

## üîí **Important Notes**

* Once locked, **the Vault Lock Policy cannot be changed or deleted**.
* You **can still add archives** ‚Äî the lock only prevents unauthorized deletes/modifications.
* You can **retrieve data anytime**, as long as it meets the retention policy.
* Vault Lock applies to **the entire vault** (not per object).

## üß© **Vault Lock vs Vault Access Policy**

| Feature     | Vault Access Policy     | Vault Lock Policy                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Purpose     | Controls who can access | Controls retention and immutability |
| Editable    | Yes                     | No (once locked)                    |
| Enforcement | IAM-based               | Compliance-based (WORM)             |
| Scope       | Access control          | Data lifecycle protection           |

---

## ‚úÖ **Best Practices**

1. **Test first** using ‚ÄúIn Progress‚Äù state before locking permanently.
2. **Store lock policy JSON in version control** for audits.
3. **Tag vaults** with compliance labels (`Environment:Prod`, `Compliance:SEC17a`).
4. **Enable CloudTrail** for all Glacier API calls.
5. **Use Vault Lock with MFA Delete (for S3-based Glacier)** for maximum security.
6. **Combine with Glacier retrieval policies** to control access speed & cost.

| Feature              | Description                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**          | Enforce immutable, WORM-style retention for Glacier data |
| **Configuration**    | Vault-level JSON policy                                  |
| **Lock Phases**      | Initiate ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Complete                               |
