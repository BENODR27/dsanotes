## **When to Use Which**

### **Use Global Accelerator if:**

- Your app is **dynamic** and cannot be cached.
- You need **TCP or UDP traffic acceleration**.
- You require **global static IP addresses**.
- You want **automatic failover** to healthy endpoints across regions.
- Example: Multi-region API, gaming backend, VoIP apps.

### **Use CloudFront if:**

- Your app has **static or cacheable content** (HTML, CSS, JS, images, video).
- You want **edge caching** to reduce origin load.
- Your traffic is **HTTP/HTTPS** only.
- You want **signed URLs/cookies**, compression, or content-based caching.
- Example: Angular/React frontend, S3-hosted website, media streaming.

### **Use Both Together:**

- **Global Accelerator** routes **dynamic API traffic** globally ‚Üí optimizes TCP/UDP paths.
- **CloudFront** serves **frontend static content** globally ‚Üí caching + SSL + geo restriction.
- Example: Angular frontend served via CloudFront + Node.js API served via Global Accelerator ‚Üí full low-latency global app.

## **Visual Architecture Example**

```
User (Global)
   ‚îÇ
   ‚îú‚îÄ CloudFront (cached Angular / images / JS) ‚Üí S3
   ‚îÇ
   ‚îî‚îÄ Global Accelerator (API / TCP / UDP traffic) ‚Üí ALB / EC2 (Node.js)
```

## **Key Takeaways**

1. **CloudFront** = CDN + caching + HTTP/HTTPS acceleration
2. **Global Accelerator** = TCP/UDP routing + global static IP + automatic failover
3. They **complement each other** in multi-region, global applications.
4. Choose based on **traffic type**, **caching need**, and **failover requirements**.

I can also make a **side-by-side architecture diagram** showing **Angular frontend via CloudFront + Node.js API via Global Accelerator**, which visually explains how both services work together for a global app.

Do you want me to create that diagram?
