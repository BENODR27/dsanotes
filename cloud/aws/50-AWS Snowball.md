# **AWS Snowball – Overview**

**AWS Snowball** is a **petabyte-scale data transport solution** that helps you **transfer large amounts of data** into and out of AWS **without using the Internet**. It’s ideal when transferring **large datasets** over the network would be slow, costly, or impractical.

Snowball is part of the **AWS Snow Family**, which includes **Snowball Edge**, **Snowcone**, and **Snowmobile**.

## **How Snowball Works**

1. **Create Job** in AWS Console:

   - Choose **import or export**, device type, and target S3 bucket.

2. **AWS Ships Device**:

   - Snowball device arrives at your site.

3. **Connect & Transfer Data**:

   - Connect via **network (Ethernet)**.
   - Use **Snowball client or S3 APIs** to copy data.

4. **Ship Back to AWS**:

   - Device automatically **encrypts and seals data**.
   - Ship it back using **courier**.

5. **Data Imported to S3**:

   - AWS validates and uploads data to the target bucket.

6. **Automatic Device Wipe**:

   - Ensures no data remains on the device.

---

## **Step-by-Step AWS Snowball Data Import**

### **Step 1: Create Snowball Job**

1. Open **AWS Management Console → Snow Family → Create job**
2. Choose **Job Type**:

   - `Import into Amazon S3` or `Export from S3`

3. Select **S3 bucket** for data transfer.
4. Choose **Snowball device type** (Standard / Edge).
5. Optionally configure **IAM role and encryption key**.
6. Review & create job → AWS ships device.

---

### **Step 2: Connect Device & Transfer Data**

1. Connect Snowball to your **local network**.
2. Install **Snowball client** (Windows/Linux/Mac).
3. Unlock device using **job manifest key** from AWS console.
4. Transfer data using:

```bash
snowball cp local-folder s3://bucket-name/ --recursive
```

- Supports **multi-threaded transfers**, resuming if interrupted.

---

### **Step 3: Ship Back to AWS**

- Once transfer completes, Snowball is **shipped back to AWS**.
- AWS imports data to the target **S3 bucket**.

---

### **Step 4: Verification & Decommission**

- AWS verifies data integrity using **SHA-256 checksums**.
- Device is **wiped securely**.

---

## **Security Features**

- **256-bit AES encryption** with keys managed via **KMS**.
- **Tamper-resistant hardware** with secure boot.
- **Egress protection** — device cannot be read without manifest key.
- **Automatic wiping** after job completion.

---

## **Use Cases**

1. **Large-scale Data Migration**

   - Move 50 TB–100 PB from on-premises to AWS.

2. **Backup & Archival**

   - Transfer backup sets without consuming network bandwidth.

3. **Disaster Recovery**

   - Quickly move critical data to AWS for DR.

4. **Edge Computing**

   - Snowball Edge runs **EC2 instances** to process data locally before shipping.

5. **Media & Entertainment**

   - Large video libraries or VFX files transfer to S3.

---

## **Pricing Overview**

- **Job Fee**: Fixed per Snowball job (~$200–$300 per device, varies by region & size)
- **Daily Charge**: If device is held longer than included days (~$15/day)
- **Data Transfer Fee**: Included for import jobs (no extra cost to transfer into AWS)
- **Export Jobs**: Charged based on data size shipped back to you

> Pricing is cheaper than transferring petabytes over Internet for most enterprise-scale workloads.

## **Snowball vs Snowball Edge vs Snowmobile**

| Service       | Size     | Compute | Purpose                       |
| ------------- | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------- |
| Snowball      | 50–80 TB | No      | Basic offline S3 transfer     |
| Snowball Edge | 42–80 TB | Yes     | Edge processing + storage     |
| Snowmobile    | 100 PB+  | N/A     | Massive data center migration |

---

## **Enterprise Tips**

1. **Use multiple devices for parallel transfer** if you have **hundreds of TBs**.
2. **Use S3 bucket policies and KMS keys** to secure sensitive data.
3. **Validate transfer** using Snowball client before shipping.
4. Combine with **Snowball Edge compute** to preprocess data locally (compression, encryption, filtering).
5. Use **job tracking** in AWS console to monitor delivery, data transfer, and completion.

---

✅ **Summary**

- **AWS Snowball** is ideal for **large-scale, secure, offline data transfer**.
- Supports **encryption, tamper-proof hardware, edge compute**.
- Part of **Snow Family** for all scales: Snowcone, Snowball, Snowmobile.
- Works seamlessly with **S3 APIs** → integrates into enterprise data pipelines.

Ah! I see what you’re asking — you’re wondering **why you would download files from S3 to a Snowball device**, and why this step exists. Let’s clarify carefully.

---

# **AWS Snowball – Why Download from S3 to the Device**

Snowball is not just for importing data **into AWS**, it’s also used for **exporting large datasets from AWS to on-premises**.

---

## **Use Cases**

1. **Exporting Large S3 Data**

   * If you have **terabytes or petabytes of data in S3** and want to **move it to your data center** or a location with limited internet, downloading over the network would be too slow or costly.
   * Snowball allows **offline export** by shipping a physical device to your location.

2. **Compliance / Data Residency**

   * Certain organizations (finance, government, healthcare) need **on-prem copies of cloud data** for compliance or auditing.
   * Snowball ensures secure, encrypted offline transfer.

3. **Disaster Recovery**

   * You may want an **on-prem backup** of critical S3 data.
   * Snowball exports S3 data physically to your site for DR purposes.

---

## **How the Export Process Works**

1. **Create an Export Job in AWS Console**

   * Select S3 bucket(s) to export
   * Choose Snowball device type (Standard / Edge)
   * AWS ships the device to you

2. **AWS Preloads Data**

   * AWS internally **copies your S3 data to the Snowball device** before shipping
   * This is why you “download from S3” — it happens **on AWS’s side**, not over your Internet

3. **Device Arrives On-Site**

   * Connect to your local network
   * Unlock device using **Job Manifest / Unlock Code**
   * Copy data **from Snowball to your local servers**

4. **Return Device (Optional)**

   * If you want to reuse the device for another export, you can ship it back; otherwise, AWS wipes it securely.

---

### **Important Points**

* You **do not need to download terabytes of S3 data over the internet** — that’s the whole point of Snowball.
* The “download from S3 to Snowball” step **happens inside AWS** before the device ships.
* On-prem, you simply **copy files from the Snowball device** to your local storage.
* Data is **encrypted**, so it’s secure during shipping.

---

## **Example Scenario**

* Company has **500 TB of historical logs in S3**.
* They need to archive them in their on-prem data center.
* Export via Snowball:

  1. Create **export job in AWS console** → AWS copies 500 TB onto Snowball device.
  2. AWS ships Snowball → device arrives on-site.
  3. IT team copies data to local storage.
* ✅ No need for slow Internet download, secure, fast.

---

✅ **Summary**

| Step                          | Where It Happens   | Internet Required?          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Copy S3 → Snowball            | AWS Data Center    | ❌ No (internal AWS network) |
| Ship Snowball → Customer      | Physical transport | ❌ No                        |
| Copy Snowball → Local Storage | Customer Site      | ❌ No                        |

**Why:** To efficiently move **large datasets from AWS to on-premises** without consuming bandwidth or time.

If you want, I can draw a **diagram showing the export flow from S3 → Snowball → On-Prem**, which makes it **visually clear** for understanding and presentations.

Do you want me to make that diagram?
