# **AWS Storage Gateway – Overview**

**AWS Storage Gateway** is a **hybrid cloud storage service** that enables your on-premises applications to seamlessly use **AWS cloud storage**.

It provides three main types of gateways:

| Type               | Description                                                            | Use Case                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **File Gateway**   | Presents **S3 buckets as NFS/SMB shares**                              | Backup, file-based apps, media repositories |
| **Volume Gateway** | Provides **block storage (iSCSI volumes)** backed by S3/Glacier        | Backup, disaster recovery, cloud tiering    |
| **Tape Gateway**   | Virtual **VTL (Virtual Tape Library)** integrated with backup software | Replace physical tapes, archive to Glacier  |

---

# **Step-by-Step: Using AWS Storage Gateway (File Gateway Example)**

---

## **Step 1: Planning**

1. **Decide Gateway Type** (File, Volume, Tape)
2. **Network & Security**

   - On-premises network must allow outbound HTTPS to AWS
   - Security group allows communication between gateway VM and AWS endpoints

3. **Storage Location**

   - File Gateway caches frequently accessed files on local disk
   - AWS S3 is the primary cloud storage

---

## **Step 2: Deploy the Gateway**

### Option A: VM Appliance (VMware/Hyper-V/EC2)

1. Download the **Storage Gateway VM** image from AWS.
2. Deploy on your hypervisor (vSphere, Hyper-V) or as an EC2 instance (for hybrid testing).
3. Assign IP address and ensure internet access.

### Option B: Hardware Appliance

- AWS provides **Snowball Edge** or other compatible hardware if needed.

---

## **Step 3: Activate Gateway**

1. Open **AWS Console → Storage Gateway → Gateways → Activate Gateway**.
2. Enter:

   - **Gateway Name**
   - **Region**
   - **Gateway Type** (File, Volume, Tape)

3. Choose **activation key** provided by VM appliance (from local VM webpage).

---

## **Step 4: Configure Storage**

1. For **File Gateway**:

   - Create **local cache disk** → stores frequently accessed files
   - Connect **AWS S3 bucket** as backend storage

2. For **Volume Gateway**:

   - Create **iSCSI volumes**
   - Map them to your servers (block storage)

3. For **Tape Gateway**:

   - Create **virtual tapes** in **VTL**
   - Integrate with backup software

---

## **Step 5: Create File Shares (File Gateway)**

1. Go to **File Shares → Create File Share**
2. Choose:

   - **S3 bucket** for storage
   - **Protocol:** NFS or SMB
   - **Access Control:** IAM role / Active Directory integration

3. Configure optional settings:

   - Object ACLs
   - File permissions
   - Cache refresh policies

---

## **Step 6: Mount File Share on Local Server**

- **NFS Example (Linux)**:

```bash
sudo mount -t nfs -o vers=4.1 gateway_ip:/share_name /mnt/fsx
```

- **SMB Example (Windows)**:

```powershell
net use Z: \\gateway_ip\share_name
```

- Now local apps can **read/write to the share**, while data is stored in **S3**.

---

## **Step 7: Use in Applications**

- Node.js Example:

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
const path = "/mnt/fsx/test.txt";

// Write file
fs.writeFileSync(path, "Hello Storage Gateway!");

// Read file
const data = fs.readFileSync(path, "utf-8");
console.log(data);
```

- Spring Boot / Java apps can use `/mnt/fsx` or `Z:\` as normal file storage.

---

## **Step 8: Backup & Tiering**

- Files written to gateway are automatically **uploaded to S3**.
- **Volume Gateway** can asynchronously **snapshot volumes to S3** for DR.
- **Tape Gateway** writes virtual tapes to **Glacier** for archival.

---

## **Step 9: Monitoring & Maintenance**

- **CloudWatch Metrics**: cache hits, uploads, bandwidth
- **CloudTrail**: track all access to S3 via gateway
- **IAM Roles**: control access to buckets
- **Automatic software updates** via Storage Gateway

---

## **Best Practices**

1. **Sizing cache properly** → frequently accessed files stay local
2. **Enable encryption** → at rest (S3) and in transit (HTTPS)
3. **Integrate with AD/LDAP** for SMB access
4. **Enable versioning on S3** for backups and recovery
5. **Monitor metrics** to optimize bandwidth and cache

---

### **Architecture Example: File Gateway**

```
On-Prem EC2 / Local Servers
         │
         ▼
AWS Storage Gateway (File Gateway)
         │
   Local Cache (Disk)
         │
         ▼
   AWS S3 Bucket (Cloud Storage)
```

- Local apps read/write to the gateway → data cached locally → automatically uploaded to S3
- Works **offline temporarily**, syncs when internet is available

---

✅ **Summary**

- AWS Storage Gateway **bridges on-premises apps to cloud storage**.
- Supports **file shares, block storage, and tape**.
- Can be **accessed like normal file system** on-prem, while storing data in **S3 or Glacier**.
- Provides **secure, scalable, hybrid cloud storage** for enterprise workloads.

# **Why AWS Storage Gateway Is Needed**

AWS Storage Gateway is used to **bridge on-premises environments with AWS cloud storage**. Enterprises often have **existing applications that expect local storage** and **cannot directly use S3 or cloud storage APIs**. Storage Gateway provides **transparent integration** with cloud storage while keeping on-premises access seamless.

**Key Benefits:**

1. **Hybrid Cloud Integration**

   - Local apps access AWS storage **without modifying the app**.

2. **Bandwidth Optimization**

   - Uses **local caching** to reduce frequent uploads/downloads.

3. **Disaster Recovery & Backup**

   - Automatically syncs local data to **S3 or Glacier** for DR.

4. **Cost Efficiency**

   - Move old/backups to cloud (S3/Glacier) → reduces on-prem storage costs.

5. **Compliance & Security**

   - Supports encryption, access control, and audit logging.

# **Use Cases with Examples**

| Use Case                       | Description                                   | Example                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backup & Archival**          | Store local backups in the cloud              | Company uses Tape Gateway to move nightly backups of databases to Glacier, replacing physical tapes.                      |
| **Disaster Recovery (DR)**     | Keep offsite copies for recovery              | Volume Gateway snapshots EC2 or on-prem servers’ volumes → can restore quickly in AWS during site failure.                |
| **Hybrid File Shares**         | Make cloud storage accessible as local shares | File Gateway exposes an S3 bucket as an SMB/NFS share → users continue saving files locally, but data is in S3.           |
| **Cloud Tiering**              | Reduce on-premises storage costs              | Frequently used files cached locally; older files automatically uploaded to S3 → reduces expensive on-prem storage.       |
| **Data Center Migration**      | Gradual migration to AWS cloud                | Use Storage Gateway to mirror file shares to S3 while slowly decommissioning on-prem storage.                             |
| **Media & Content Processing** | Store large files in cloud transparently      | Video editing teams save media to File Gateway → files stored in S3 → can be processed or distributed globally.           |
| **IoT & Edge Integration**     | Local caching before sending to cloud         | Sensors in factories write to File Gateway → cached locally and asynchronously uploaded to S3 → enables analytics in AWS. |

# **Real-World Example**

**Scenario:** A financial institution backs up 50 TB of transaction logs daily.

- **Problem:** Existing backup software writes to on-prem tapes → slow, manual shipping, and risk of loss.
- **Solution:**

  1. Deploy **Tape Gateway**.
  2. Backup software writes virtual tapes to gateway.
  3. Data automatically stored in **Glacier**.
  4. Old tapes are decommissioned.

- **Benefit:** Automated, cost-efficient, secure backup without changing backup workflows.

---

**Scenario 2:** Media Company needs a hybrid file share.

- Employees save videos to local SMB share (File Gateway).
- **File Gateway** automatically uploads content to **S3** for cloud editing and global distribution.
- Local cache ensures **fast access**, cloud ensures **durability and scalability**.

---

✅ **Summary**
