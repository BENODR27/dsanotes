Absolutely — the **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** is a key AWS networking service, and it’s **exam-relevant for SAP-C02** because it handles **extreme performance, high availability, and low-latency workloads**. Let’s go deep.

---

## 🧭 1. What is a Network Load Balancer?

* **Type:** Layer 4 (Transport layer) load balancer (TCP/UDP/TLS)
* **Purpose:** Distributes **millions of requests per second** while maintaining **ultra-low latency**
* **Best For:** Applications requiring **extreme performance, static IP, or preservation of source IP**

**Key Features:**

* Handles **volatile traffic patterns**
* Can **scale automatically** to millions of requests
* **Static IP support** for each AZ via Elastic IPs
* **Preserves client IP** (unlike Classic or ALB which can use proxy headers)
* Supports **TLS termination** (TLS listener)
* Supports **UDP/TCP** protocols (e.g., gaming, IoT, DNS)

## ⚙️ 2. NLB Components

| Component        | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Listener**     | Port/protocol combination (e.g., TCP 443) that receives client traffic       |
| **Target Group** | Group of EC2 instances, IP addresses, or Lambda functions to forward traffic |
| **Target**       | Actual resource receiving traffic (EC2, IP, Lambda)                          |
| **Health Check** | TCP or HTTP(S) check to determine target health                              |

## 🧩 3. NLB vs Other Load Balancers

| Feature             | ALB                    | NLB                                   | CLB (Classic)            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Layer**           | 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)         | 4 (TCP/UDP)                           | 4/7                      |
| **Protocols**       | HTTP/HTTPS             | TCP/UDP/TLS                           | TCP/SSL/HTTP/HTTPS       |
| **Performance**     | Moderate               | Millions of requests/sec, low latency | Low to moderate          |
| **IP Preservation** | X-Forwarded-For header | Preserved source IP                   | Only with proxy protocol |
| **Static IP**       | No                     | Yes, per AZ                           | No                       |
| **TLS Termination** | Yes                    | Yes                                   | Limited                  |

**Exam Tip 💡:**

* Use **NLB** when you need **high performance, static IP, or TCP/UDP support**.
* Use **ALB** for HTTP/HTTPS routing, host/path-based routing.

## 🌐 4. NLB Features in Detail

### 🔹 Protocols Supported

* TCP, TLS, UDP, TCP_UDP
* TLS termination is supported on NLB

### 🔹 High Availability

* NLB spans **multiple AZs** automatically
* Each AZ can have its **own static Elastic IP** for deterministic addressing

### 🔹 Source IP Preservation

* Preserves **client IP**, so backend servers can log real IP addresses
* Supports **Proxy Protocol v2** if needed for downstream apps

### 🔹 Health Checks

* Can be **TCP or HTTP**
* Health check frequency is **configurable**
* Unhealthy targets are automatically removed from the routing pool

### 🔹 Target Types

* **Instance** → EC2 targets
* **IP** → Any IP within VPC or peered VPC
* **Lambda** → Forward requests to Lambda functions (TCP only with NLB)

## ⚡ 5. Use Cases

| Use Case                 | Why NLB?                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Real-time gaming         | Ultra-low latency TCP/UDP, millions of requests/sec        |
| IoT ingestion            | UDP protocol support, high scalability                     |
| Financial trading        | Preserves source IP, low jitter                            |
| TLS offload for TCP apps | TLS termination at NLB layer                               |
| Static IP requirement    | Provides predictable Elastic IP per AZ                     |
| Hybrid connectivity      | Can integrate with **VPN, Direct Connect, or PrivateLink** |

## 🧩 6. Key Configurations

### 🔹 Cross-Zone Load Balancing

* Disabled by default
* If enabled → distributes traffic evenly across targets in all AZs

### 🔹 De-registration Delay

* Default: 300 seconds
* Can adjust to gracefully remove targets

### 🔹 Logging

* NLB supports **access logs to S3** (for auditing or analytics)
