Perfect! Let’s cover **creating a Read Replica in Amazon Aurora**, which works a bit differently from standard RDS Postgres. Aurora replicas are **highly optimized, almost synchronous, and can scale reads** across multiple instances.

---

## 🧭 1. Key Points About Aurora Read Replicas

- **Aurora architecture:** Shared storage across all instances in a cluster.
- **Read replicas:**

  - Called **Aurora Replicas**
  - Can serve read traffic **immediately** with **<10 ms replication lag**
  - Can promote any replica to **cluster writer** quickly

- **Supported engines:** Aurora MySQL and Aurora PostgreSQL
- **Maximum replicas per cluster:** Up to **15**

**Exam Tip 💡:** Aurora replicas are **not like standard RDS async replicas**—they scale reads **within the cluster** almost synchronously.

## ⚙️ 2. Creating Aurora Read Replica via Console

### Step 1: Open RDS Console

- Navigate to **AWS Console → RDS → Databases**
- Select your **Aurora cluster** (writer instance).

### Step 2: Add Replica

- Click **Actions → Add reader**
- Configure:

  - **DB instance identifier** → e.g., `aurora-replica-1`
  - **Instance class** → e.g., `db.r6g.large`
  - **Availability zone** → Optional, can leave for multi-AZ distribution
  - **Public accessibility** → Yes/No (depends on use case)

### Step 3: Launch

- Click **Add reader**
- AWS creates a new Aurora Replica and registers it in the cluster automatically.

## 🔹 3. Creating Aurora Read Replica via CLI

```bash
aws rds create-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier aurora-replica-1 \
    --db-cluster-identifier my-aurora-cluster \
    --engine aurora-postgresql \
    --db-instance-class db.r6g.large
```

- **`--db-cluster-identifier`** specifies the existing Aurora cluster.
- Aurora automatically handles replication using shared storage; no need for WAL shipping.

## 🌐 4. Aurora Read Replica Features

| Feature              | Description                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Replication type** | Near-synchronous (shared storage, low lag)                    |
| **Read scalability** | Up to 15 Aurora Replicas per cluster                          |
| **Failover**         | Replica can be **promoted** to cluster writer in seconds      |
| **Multi-AZ**         | Aurora automatically distributes instances across AZs         |
| **Cross-region**     | Supports **Aurora Global Database** for cross-region replicas |

---

## ⚡ 5. Promotion of Aurora Read Replica

- Can promote to **cluster writer** in same or different region (if using Aurora Global Database).
- Steps:

  - Console → Actions → Promote Reader
  - CLI:

    ```bash
    aws rds promote-read-replica-db-cluster \
        --db-cluster-identifier my-aurora-cluster
    ```

- **Promotion is faster than standard RDS**, because Aurora shares the storage volume.

## 🧠 6. Use Cases / Exam Scenarios

| Scenario                               | Solution                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Scale out read-heavy workloads         | Add Aurora Replicas                               |
| Analytics or reporting off the main DB | Aurora Replicas serve read traffic                |
| Failover / high availability           | Promote Aurora Replica to writer                  |
| Global low-latency reads               | Aurora Global Database with cross-region replicas |

**Exam Tip 💡:** Aurora Replicas = **read scaling within cluster**, Global Aurora = **cross-region read replicas**.

I can also make a **diagram showing Aurora cluster with writer + multiple readers + cross-region Global DB**, highlighting **read scaling and promotion**, which is very useful for **SAP-C02 exam questions**.

Do you want me to create that diagram?
