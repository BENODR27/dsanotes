Here’s a thorough breakdown of **Azure Bastion**, including its purpose, architecture, and benefits:

---

## **1. What is Azure Bastion?**

**Azure Bastion** is a **fully managed PaaS service** that provides **secure and seamless RDP/SSH access to your Azure VMs** directly from the Azure portal, **without exposing public IPs**.

**Key idea:**
No need to open inbound ports (RDP 3389 or SSH 22) on your VM. All access happens **over SSL (port 443)** via the Azure portal.

---

## **2. How Azure Bastion Works**

**Architecture Overview:**

1. **Bastion Host**

   - Deployed in your **virtual network (VNet)**.
   - Provides a **jump host** to connect securely to VMs.

2. **Connection Flow:**

   - User connects via **Azure Portal**.
   - Azure Bastion establishes a **secure RDP/SSH session** to the VM.
   - No public IP is needed on the VM itself.

3. **Security:**

   - All traffic is **encrypted over SSL**.
   - Reduces exposure to brute-force attacks on RDP/SSH.
   - No client-side VPN needed.

---

## **3. Deployment Requirements**

- **VNet**: Bastion is deployed inside a VNet.
- **Subnet**: Must create a **dedicated subnet** named `AzureBastionSubnet` with a minimum **/27** address range.
- **VMs**: Can connect to any VM in the same VNet or **peered VNet**.
- **Public IP**: Bastion requires a **public IP** but VMs themselves do **not**.

## **4. Benefits of Azure Bastion**

| Benefit            | Explanation                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Secure access**  | No need for public IP on VMs, reduces attack surface. |
| **Seamless**       | RDP/SSH directly in browser via Azure Portal.         |
| **Scale**          | Managed service scales automatically.                 |
| **Compliance**     | All access is logged, supports auditing.              |
| **Cross-platform** | Supports Windows (RDP) and Linux (SSH).               |

## **5. How to Use Azure Bastion**

1. Deploy Bastion in your VNet (dedicated subnet required).
2. Navigate to the VM in Azure Portal.
3. Click **Connect → Bastion**.
4. Enter **username/password** or **SSH key**.
5. Start session **directly in the browser**.

Optional: You can also use **Bastion with your local RDP/SSH client** through **native client support** (private preview/GA depending on region).

---

## **6. When to Use Azure Bastion**

- Enterprises with strict **network security policies**.
- VMs without public IPs that still need remote access.
- Avoiding **VPN setup** for ad-hoc connections.
- Ensuring **auditable, logged access** to production servers.

---

✅ **Summary:**

Azure Bastion = **secure, managed jump host** for Azure VMs → **browser-based RDP/SSH access** without exposing public IPs or opening risky ports.
