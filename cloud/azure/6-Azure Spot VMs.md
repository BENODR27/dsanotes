Here’s a clear breakdown of **Azure Spot VMs**, including how they work, use cases, and limitations:

---

## **1. What are Azure Spot VMs?**

**Azure Spot Virtual Machines** are **unused Azure compute capacity** that you can purchase at a **significant discount**—sometimes up to **90% off the pay-as-you-go price**.

**Key idea:**
You get **lower-cost VMs**, but **they can be evicted by Azure** when the capacity is needed for regular-priced workloads.

---

## **2. How Spot VMs Work**

1. **Pricing Model:**

   - Spot VMs are **priced dynamically** based on available capacity.
   - You pay only for the VM while it runs.

2. **Eviction Policies:**
   Spot VMs can be **evicted** when:

   - Capacity is no longer available.
   - Spot price exceeds the maximum price you are willing to pay.

   **Eviction options:**

   - **Deallocate** → VM is stopped but resources preserved (can restart later).
   - **Delete** → VM and associated temporary resources are deleted.

3. **Priority:**

   - Spot VMs have **lower priority** than standard VMs.
   - Ideal for **interruptible workloads**.

## **3. Use Cases**

Spot VMs are suitable for **workloads that can tolerate interruptions**:

| Use Case                | Explanation                                                     |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Batch processing        | Large compute jobs that can resume later.                       |
| Dev/test environments   | Short-lived test VMs at low cost.                               |
| Stateless applications  | Apps where state can be saved externally.                       |
| Rendering or simulation | Video rendering, ML training jobs that can checkpoint progress. |

## **4. Limitations**

| Limitation                       | Details                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interruption**                 | VMs can be evicted anytime.                              |
| **No SLA**                       | Spot VMs don’t have standard uptime guarantees.          |
| **Temporary storage**            | Data on ephemeral OS disks may be lost if VM is deleted. |
| **Not for production workloads** | Critical apps should not rely solely on Spot VMs.        |

## **5. How to Deploy Spot VMs**

1. **Choose Spot VM** during VM creation.
2. Set **max price** (optional) – if the spot price exceeds this, VM is evicted.
3. Select **eviction policy**: Deallocate or Delete.
4. Deploy like any other VM.

**Integration tips:**

- Combine Spot VMs with **scale sets** for large-scale, low-cost compute clusters.
- Use **preemption-aware workloads** (e.g., job checkpointing).

---

✅ **Summary:**

- **Azure Spot VMs** = cheap, interruptible compute.
- **Pros**: Low cost, scalable, ideal for batch/temporary workloads.
- **Cons**: Can be evicted anytime, no SLA, not for mission-critical apps.
