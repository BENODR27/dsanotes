Here’s a clear breakdown of **Azure Files, Managed Disks, and Temporary Storage**, their differences, and use cases:

---

## **1. Azure Files**

**Definition:**
**Azure Files** is a **fully managed file share service** in the cloud, accessible via **SMB (Server Message Block)** or **NFS (Network File System)** protocols.

**Key Points:**

- **Managed service**: No need to manage VMs for file storage.
- **Accessible from anywhere**: Windows, Linux, macOS.
- **Persistent storage**: Data survives VM restarts.
- **Integration**: Can be mounted on Azure VMs or on-premises via VPN/ExpressRoute.

**Use Cases:**

- Shared storage for applications or users.
- Lift-and-shift migrations that need a file share.
- Home directories or content repositories.
- Persistent storage for containers.

## **2. Azure Managed Disks**

**Definition:**
**Managed Disks** are **block-level storage volumes** used with **Azure Virtual Machines**. Azure manages the storage account, scalability, and durability.

**Key Points:**

- Comes in **types**: Standard HDD, Standard SSD, Premium SSD, Ultra Disk.
- Each VM disk is **independent and persistent**.
- Supports **snapshots and backups**.
- Managed by Azure → no need to handle storage accounts manually.

**Use Cases:**

- OS disk for VM.
- Data disk for applications or databases.
- High-performance workloads using Premium/Ultra disks.

---

## **3. Temporary Storage**

**Definition:**
**Temporary storage** is the **ephemeral local disk** attached to Azure VMs. Typically mounted as **D: drive on Windows** or **/mnt on Linux**.

**Key Points:**

- **Non-persistent**: Data is lost on VM deallocation, stop, or crash.
- Used for **page/swap files, caches, or scratch space**.
- **Faster** than managed disks because it’s local to the VM host.

**Use Cases:**

- Page file / swap space.
- Application temporary data.
- Scratch space for processing workloads.

## **Comparison Table**

| Feature     | Azure Files                    | Managed Disks                 | Temporary Storage        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Type        | File storage (SMB/NFS)         | Block storage (OS/Data disks) | Ephemeral local storage  |
| Persistence | Yes                            | Yes                           | No                       |
| Access      | VMs, on-premises, containers   | Only attached VM              | Only attached VM         |
| Performance | Moderate, depends on tier      | Standard/Premium/Ultra        | Very fast, VM-local      |
| Use Case    | Shared files, home directories | OS/data disks, databases      | Swap, caches, temp files |

---

✅ **Summary:**

- **Azure Files** → persistent shared file storage.
- **Managed Disks** → persistent VM-attached block storage.
- **Temporary Storage** → fast, ephemeral scratch disk for VM-local workloads.
