Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of **Azure Load Balancer**, including types, features, and use cases:

---

## **1. What is Azure Load Balancer?**

**Azure Load Balancer (ALB)** is a **Layer 4 (Transport Layer) load balancing service** that distributes **incoming network traffic** across **virtual machines or services** in a **virtual network**.

**Key idea:**
It provides **high availability and scalability** for applications by distributing traffic efficiently.

## **2. Types of Azure Load Balancer**

| Type                                 | Purpose                                        | Scope                | Key Features                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public Load Balancer**             | Distributes **internet-facing traffic**        | Public IP            | Routes traffic from internet to VMs in a backend pool                       |
| **Internal (Private) Load Balancer** | Distributes **internal traffic** within VNet   | Private IP           | Used for internal apps, databases, or services                              |
| **Standard vs Basic**                | Standard = production-ready, advanced features | Basic = simple, free | Standard has HA zones, secure by default, metrics; Basic has fewer features |

## **3. Components of Azure Load Balancer**

1. **Frontend IP Configuration**

   - Public IP (for public LB) or private IP (for internal LB).

2. **Backend Pool**

   - Collection of VMs or NICs that receive traffic.

3. **Health Probes**

   - Monitors backend VM health (TCP, HTTP, or HTTPS).
   - Only healthy VMs receive traffic.

4. **Load Balancing Rules**

   - Maps incoming traffic from frontend to backend pool.
   - Defines **port, protocol, session persistence**.

5. **Outbound Rules (optional)**

   - Manage outbound connectivity from backend pool to internet.

---

## **4. Features**

- **High availability**: Distributes traffic across multiple VMs in an availability set or zone.
- **Automatic reconfiguration**: Adds/removes VMs automatically.
- **Inbound NAT rules**: Forward specific ports to a VM for management access.
- **Scaling**: Can handle millions of flows per second.
- **Zone-redundant**: Standard LB supports cross-AZ redundancy.

## **5. Use Cases**

| Scenario             | How ALB Helps                                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Web apps             | Distribute HTTP/HTTPS traffic across multiple VMs        |
| Internal services    | Use internal LB to balance traffic among backend servers |
| High throughput apps | Handle millions of connections with low latency          |
| HA apps              | Combine with Availability Sets or Zones for redundancy   |
| Port forwarding      | NAT rules to access specific VMs                         |

---

## **6. Public vs Internal Load Balancer Comparison**

| Feature      | Public LB      | Internal LB                  |
| ------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| IP Type      | Public         | Private                      |
| Connectivity | Internet → VMs | VMs → VMs (internal)         |
| Use Case     | Web apps, APIs | Databases, internal services |
| NAT          | Optional       | Optional                     |

---

✅ **Summary:**

- **Azure Load Balancer** = Layer 4 traffic distribution across VMs.
- **Public LB** → Internet-facing apps.
- **Internal LB** → Internal apps/services.
- **Standard LB** → Production-grade, zone-redundant, secure.
- **Basic LB** → Simple, cost-effective, limited features.
