Here’s a **comprehensive roadmap** to prepare for the **Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect** or **Professional DevOps Engineer** certification, tailored for a **Senior Developer/Engineer (5+ years experience)**. This plan is **strategic, hands-on, and architecture-focused**, aimed at mastering real-world GCP scenarios—not just passing the exam.

---

## 🎯 Goal:

Become **GCP Professional Certified** and **cloud-ready at an architect/devops level** — able to design, build, secure, and optimize cloud-native solutions on GCP.

---

## 📅 Suggested Timeline: **8–12 weeks** (can be compressed to 4–6 if focused full-time)
