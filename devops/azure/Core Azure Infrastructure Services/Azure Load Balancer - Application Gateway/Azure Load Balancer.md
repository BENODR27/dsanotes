Absolutely! Let’s go **step by step** to create an **Azure Load Balancer (ALB)**. I’ll cover **frontend IP, backend pool, health probe, and load balancing rules** for a basic setup.

---

## **Step 1: Decide Type of Load Balancer**

Azure Load Balancer has two main types:

- **Public Load Balancer** → Exposes a public IP to the internet.
- **Internal (Private) Load Balancer** → Only accessible inside your virtual network (VNet).

> Choose based on whether your application needs public internet access or internal traffic only.

---

## **Step 2: Create a Load Balancer**

1. Go to **Azure Portal → Create a Resource → Networking → Load Balancer**.
2. Fill in the **Basics**:

   - **Subscription** and **Resource Group**
   - **Name** of the Load Balancer
   - **Region** (same as your VMs for low latency)
   - **Type**: Public or Internal
   - **SKU**: Standard (recommended for production) or Basic (for dev/test)

3. Click **Next: Frontend IP configuration**.

---

## **Step 3: Configure Frontend IP**

- **Frontend IP** is where clients connect.
- For **Public LB**:

  - Assign a **public IP** (either new or existing).

- For **Internal LB**:

  - Assign a **private IP** from your VNet.

- Click **Next: Backend Pools**.

---

## **Step 4: Create Backend Pool**

- **Backend pool** = VMs or VM Scale Sets that will receive traffic.
- Click **Add a backend pool**:

  - **Name** the pool
  - **Target type**: Virtual machine, IP address, or VMSS
  - Select the **VMs/NICs** you want to include

- Click **Next: Health Probes**.

---

## **Step 5: Configure Health Probe**

- Health probes check if backend VMs are healthy. Only healthy VMs receive traffic.
- Click **Add a health probe**:

  - **Name**: e.g., `http-probe`
  - **Protocol**: TCP, HTTP, or HTTPS
  - **Port**: e.g., `80` for HTTP
  - **Path**: (for HTTP/HTTPS probes) e.g., `/health`
  - **Interval**: how often to check (seconds)
  - **Unhealthy threshold**: number of failed checks before marking VM as unhealthy

---

## **Step 6: Create Load Balancing Rule**

- Rules tell LB how to distribute traffic from frontend → backend.
- Click **Add a rule**:

  - **Name**: e.g., `http-rule`
  - **Frontend IP**: choose the one you created
  - **Protocol**: TCP/UDP (usually TCP for web apps)
  - **Port**: e.g., 80
  - **Backend Pool**: select your pool
  - **Backend Port**: e.g., 80
  - **Health Probe**: select the one you created
  - **Session Persistence**: Optional (None / Client IP / Client IP + Protocol)

---

## **Step 7: Review + Create**

- Review all settings and click **Create**.
- Once deployed, your **Load Balancer** is ready to distribute traffic to backend VMs.

---

## **Step 8: Test**

1. Assign a test web app or VM to your backend pool.
2. Make sure the backend VM is listening on the specified port.
3. Browse the **public IP** (for Public LB) or ping the **private IP** (for Internal LB) to verify traffic is routed correctly.

---

✅ **Optional Advanced Features:**

- **Outbound rules** → Control outbound connections from backend VMs
- **Inbound NAT rules** → Direct specific frontend ports to a particular VM (e.g., RDP, SSH)
- **Diagnostics logs** → Monitor traffic and health in **Azure Monitor**
