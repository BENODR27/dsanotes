⸻

Phase 4: Angular 15–19 Version-wise Feature Comparison & Migration

Goal: Be interview-ready for version-based questions.

Angular 15:
	•	Standalone Components (no need for NgModules)
	•	Directive Composition API
	•	Improved Image Directives
	•	Functional Guards and Resolvers

Angular 16:
	•	Signals (reactive primitives, alternative to Observables)
	•	DestroyRef for cleanup
	•	Required Inputs
	•	inject() function improvements
	•	Hydration for Angular SSR

Angular 17:
	•	Control Flow syntax (@if, @for)
	•	Deferrable Views (@defer, @placeholder, @loading)
	•	Zonal-less Angular with fine-tuned Change Detection
	•	Vite + esbuild integration

Angular 18:
	•	Signals are stable
	•	NgOptimizedImage updates
	•	Model-based Form APIs (experimental)
	•	Stable control flow syntax
	•	Better DevTools with Signals

Angular 19:
	•	Full Signal-based reactive primitives
	•	Required Input validation errors
	•	Signal-based forms improvements (planned)
	•	Zone.js opt-out officially supported
	•	Dependency injection optimizations
	•	Full support for control flow blocks

⸻

Phase 5: Real-time Practices & Architecture

Goal: Build deployable, scalable Angular applications.

Topics:
	•	Real Project Architecture
	•	Folder Structure
	•	Feature Modules
	•	Smart/Dumb Components
	•	Shared/Core Module
	•	Enterprise Patterns (SOLID, DRY, SRP)
	•	Component Design Patterns
	•	Presentational/Container
	•	Compound Components
	•	Higher-Order Components in Angular Style
	•	CI/CD with Angular (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
	•	Dockerizing Angular App
	•	Angular + Backend Integration (Spring Boot / Node.js)
	•	Role-Based Access Control
	•	JWT Token Authentication + Refresh Tokens

⸻

Phase 6: Angular Interview Preparation

Goal: Crack Angular Interviews at All Levels.

Study:
	•	150+ Angular Interview Questions with Answers
	•	Version Difference FAQs (15 to 19)
	•	Real Scenario-Based Questions (Optimization, Signals, SSR)
	•	System Design of Angular Applications
	•	Live Coding Practice
	•	Code Review Best Practices

⸻

Optional (Highly Recommended):
	•	Contribute to Angular Open Source to stand out.
	•	Build a Real-time Admin Dashboard using Angular 19, RxJS, NgRx, and Signals.
	•	Create a Blog or YouTube series on new Angular features to showcase expertise.
