Great — let’s go through the **Java 17/21 features** you mentioned:
These are the **modern Java language enhancements** that interviewers often ask about for senior/full-stack roles.

---

## ☕ **1. Records (Introduced in Java 16, stabilized in Java 17)**

**Purpose:** Simplify data-carrying classes (like DTOs) by removing boilerplate code for getters, constructors, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`.

### 🧩 Example (Before and After):

**Before (normal class):**

```java
class Employee {
    private final String name;
    private final int id;

    public Employee(String name, int id) {
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String name() { return name; }
    public int id() { return id; }
}
```

**After (using Record):**

```java
public record Employee(String name, int id) {}
```

✅ Automatically generates:

- `private final` fields
- A canonical constructor
- Accessor methods (`name()`, `id()`)
- `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`

**Usage:** Great for immutable DTOs in microservices, e.g., API response objects.

---

## 🛡️ **2. Sealed Classes (Java 17)**

**Purpose:** Control which other classes can extend or implement a class/interface.
It adds a layer of **type safety and design clarity** — useful in domain modeling.

### 🧩 Example:

```java
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Rectangle {}

final class Circle extends Shape {
    double radius;
}

final class Rectangle extends Shape {
    double width, height;
}
```

If you try to extend `Shape` from another class (not listed in `permits`),
you’ll get a **compile-time error**.

✅ Use Case:

- In domain models where you want a limited and known set of subclasses.

---

## 🔀 **3. Switch Expressions (Java 14+, improved in 17/21)**

**Purpose:** Make `switch` statements more concise and expressive.
They can now **return a value** and use **arrow syntax**.

### 🧩 Example:

```java
String day = "MONDAY";
String type = switch (day) {
    case "SATURDAY", "SUNDAY" -> "Weekend";
    default -> {
        System.out.println("Work day");
        yield "Weekday";
    }
};
System.out.println(type);
```

✅ Advantages:

- No more fall-through errors.
- You can assign switch directly to variables.
- Cleaner and less verbose.

---

## 🧱 **4. Text Blocks (Java 15)**

**Purpose:** Allow multiline string literals without messy `\n` and `+` concatenations.

### 🧩 Example:

```java
String json = """
    {
        "name": "John",
        "age": 30,
        "city": "Nagercoil"
    }
    """;

System.out.println(json);
```

✅ Advantages:

- Preserves formatting.
- Great for JSON, SQL, HTML, etc. inside Java code.
- Reduces syntax noise.

---

## 🔍 **5. Pattern Matching for `instanceof` (Java 16+)**

**Purpose:** Simplify type casting when using `instanceof`.

### 🧩 Example (Before and After):

**Before:**

```java
if (obj instanceof String) {
    String s = (String) obj;
    System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());
}
```

**After:**

```java
if (obj instanceof String s) {
    System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());
}
```

✅ Advantages:

- Cleaner, safer, and eliminates redundant casts.

---

## ⚡ **Bonus: Pattern Matching for Switch (Java 21)**

**Purpose:** Extends pattern matching to `switch` statements — allows matching types and deconstructing values.

### 🧩 Example:

```java
static String formatShape(Shape shape) {
    return switch (shape) {
        case Circle c -> "Circle with radius " + c.radius();
        case Rectangle r -> "Rectangle with width " + r.width() + " and height " + r.height();
        default -> "Unknown shape";
    };
}
```

✅ Enables expressive and type-safe pattern handling.

## 🧠 **How to Prepare for Interviews**

**Common Questions:**

1. What are records and how are they different from regular classes?
2. When would you use sealed classes?
3. How are switch expressions different from traditional switches?
4. How do text blocks improve code readability?
5. Can you explain pattern matching and its benefits?

**Tip:**
If asked in a **Spring Boot** context — mention how you use _Records for DTOs_, _Text Blocks for SQL/JSON templates_, and _Sealed Classes for domain modeling_.
