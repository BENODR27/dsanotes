Excellent — these **four OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) principles** form the foundation of Java and are **frequently asked in interviews**, especially for experienced developers like you (5+ years).

Let’s break them down with **definitions, real-world analogies, and Java examples** 👇

---

## ⚙️ **1. Encapsulation (Data Hiding)**

**Definition:**
Encapsulation is the process of **bundling data (variables)** and **methods (functions)** that operate on that data into a single unit (class) — while **restricting direct access** to the internal state using access modifiers (`private`, `protected`, etc.).

**Analogy:**
A **capsule** that contains medicine — you know what it does, but you can’t see or alter what’s inside.

### 🧩 Example:

```java
public class Account {
    private double balance; // data is hidden

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance; // controlled access
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) balance += amount;
    }
}
```

✅ **Key Points:**

- Variables are private.
- Access provided through public getters/setters.
- Protects data integrity and maintains control.

**Interview Tip:**
If asked, explain how **encapsulation helps achieve data security and flexibility** in large systems (like banking or microservices).

## 🧬 **2. Inheritance (Code Reusability)**

**Definition:**
Inheritance allows one class (child/subclass) to **inherit properties and behaviors** from another class (parent/superclass).
It supports **code reusability** and hierarchical classification.

**Analogy:**
A **child inherits traits from parents** — but can have its own unique features.

### 🧩 Example:

```java
class Vehicle {
    void start() { System.out.println("Vehicle started"); }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void honk() { System.out.println("Car honking"); }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.start(); // inherited
        car.honk();  // own method
    }
}
```

✅ **Key Points:**

- Use `extends` keyword.
- Promotes reusability and maintainability.
- Java supports **single inheritance** for classes but **multiple for interfaces**.

**Interview Tip:**
Be ready to explain **composition vs inheritance** (favor composition in microservices).

---

## 🎭 **3. Polymorphism (Many Forms)**

**Definition:**
Polymorphism allows **one interface to represent different underlying forms (data types)**.
It enables **method overriding (runtime)** and **method overloading (compile-time)**.

**Analogy:**
The same person acts as a **developer at work**, a **parent at home**, and a **driver on weekends** — one identity, many roles.

### 🧩 Example (Runtime Polymorphism):

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() { System.out.println("Some sound"); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() { System.out.println("Bark"); }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() { System.out.println("Meow"); }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();  // reference type: Animal, object type: Dog
        a.makeSound();         // Output: Bark
    }
}
```

✅ **Key Points:**

- **Compile-time polymorphism** → Method overloading.
- **Runtime polymorphism** → Method overriding.
- Achieved via inheritance and interfaces.

**Interview Tip:**
If asked in Spring context — mention how **Spring Beans** use **polymorphism and dependency injection** to manage multiple implementations (e.g., multiple service classes implementing the same interface).

---

## 🧱 **4. Abstraction (Hiding Implementation Details)**

**Definition:**
Abstraction is the process of **hiding complex internal implementation** and **exposing only essential features** to the user.
You define **what an object does**, not **how** it does it.

**Analogy:**
You **drive a car** without knowing how the engine works — only the steering and pedals matter.

### 🧩 Example:

```java
abstract class Payment {
    abstract void makePayment();
}

class CreditCardPayment extends Payment {
    @Override
    void makePayment() {
        System.out.println("Payment done via Credit Card");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Payment p = new CreditCardPayment();
        p.makePayment();
    }
}
```

✅ **Key Points:**

- Achieved via **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.
- Defines a contract for subclasses to implement.
- Reduces complexity and increases flexibility.

**Interview Tip:**
Explain that abstraction helps in **designing extensible APIs** — like abstracting service layers or database interactions in a microservices architecture.

## 🧠 Common Interview Questions

1. What is the difference between **abstraction** and **encapsulation**?

   - Encapsulation = Hiding _data_, Abstraction = Hiding _implementation_.

2. Can you achieve abstraction without inheritance?

   - Yes, using interfaces.

3. Explain **runtime polymorphism** with an example.
4. When would you use **composition over inheritance**?
5. How do these principles apply in a **Spring Boot microservice**?
