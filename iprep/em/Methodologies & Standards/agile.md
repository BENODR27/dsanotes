---

### 🟢 **8. What is a User Story? Give an example.**

**Answer:**
A user story captures a requirement from an end-user's perspective.

Example:

> "As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can access my account if I forget it."

---

### 🟢 **9. What is Definition of Done (DoD)?**

**Answer:**
A checklist that describes the criteria that a product increment must meet to be considered complete. It may include:

* Code complete
* Unit tested
* Reviewed and merged
* Deployed to staging
* Documented

---

### 🟢 **10. What is Velocity in Agile?**

**Answer:**
Velocity is the average number of story points completed by the team in a sprint. It helps in sprint planning and forecasting.

---

## 🔵 INTERMEDIATE/SCENARIO-BASED AGILE QUESTIONS

---

### 🔹 **11. How do you handle changing requirements mid-sprint?**

**Answer:**
Agile welcomes change, but within a sprint, change is minimized to avoid disruption. Major changes should be added to the **next sprint backlog** unless it's a critical bug or blocker.

---

### 🔹 **12. How do you estimate stories?**

**Answer:**
Using methods like:

* **Planning Poker**
* **T-shirt sizing**
* **Story Points** (based on complexity, effort, risk)

We compare stories relatively and use Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...).

---

### 🔹 **13. What if the team doesn’t finish all stories in the Sprint?**

**Answer:**
Unfinished stories are moved back to the **product backlog** or reconsidered in the **next sprint planning**. The Scrum team discusses why and adapts in the retrospective.

---

### 🔹 **14. What is a Sprint Retrospective?**

**Answer:**
A ceremony at the end of the sprint where the team reflects on:

* What went well
* What didn’t
* What can be improved

Example action item: "We will automate regression testing before the next sprint."

---

### 🔹 **15. What is the role of a Scrum Master in removing impediments?**

**Answer:**
Scrum Master identifies blockers (e.g., environment not ready, unclear requirements) and coordinates with stakeholders, infra teams, or PO to resolve them quickly.

---

## 🔴 ADVANCED / LEAD-LEVEL AGILE QUESTIONS

---

### 🔹 **16. How do you ensure quality in Agile development?**

**Answer:**

* Shift-left testing
* TDD, unit + integration tests
* Code reviews & pair programming
* CI/CD pipelines
* Static analysis (e.g., SonarQube)
* Done criteria includes testing, code quality

---

### 🔹 **17. How do you handle technical debt in Agile?**

**Answer:**
We track tech debt in the backlog (as tech stories), allocate a portion of each sprint (\~20%) to refactoring, and prioritize based on impact and risk.

---

### 🔹 **18. How do you measure team performance in Agile?**

**Answer:**

* **Velocity trends**
* **Burn-down charts**
* **Lead time / Cycle time**
* **Retrospective improvements**
* **Customer feedback**

Never measure by individual output—focus is team delivery.

---

### 🔹 **19. What is backlog grooming/refinement?**

**Answer:**
A regular session where the team and PO:

* Clarify stories
* Add acceptance criteria
* Break down large epics
* Estimate effort
* Prioritize based on business value

---

### 🔹 **20. What’s the difference between Epic, Feature, and Story?**

| Level   | Description                        |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Epic    | Large chunk of work, spans sprints |
| Feature | Functionality subset of an Epic    |
| Story   | User-level requirement             |

---

## 💬 BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONS IN AGILE CONTEXT

---

### 🔹 **21. Describe a conflict you handled during Agile development.**

**Answer:**
"In Sprint 8, two developers disagreed on tech implementation. I facilitated a quick design discussion, reviewed pros/cons, and aligned with DoD and sprint goals to decide quickly. We resolved it without blocking the sprint."

---

### 🔹 **22. Have you led a retrospective? What actions came out of it?**

**Answer:**
"Yes, during one retro we found too many hotfixes were coming mid-sprint. We worked with the PO to create a separate backlog for critical bugs and implemented a buffer strategy."

---

### 🔹 **23. How do you manage dependencies in Agile?**

**Answer:**

* Identify dependencies early during backlog grooming
* Use dependency mapping or Kanban swimlanes
* Communicate across teams (Scrum of Scrums)
* Prioritize stories with external dependencies early

---

### 🔹 **24. Agile vs Waterfall – which one is better and why?**

**Answer:**
Agile is better for projects with:

* Changing requirements
* Fast feedback loops
* Early and frequent delivery

Waterfall suits:

* Fixed-scope, fixed-budget
* Compliance-heavy domains

---

### 🔹 **25. How do you coach a team new to Agile?**

**Answer:**

* Introduce Scrum framework via workshops

Sure! Here’s a detailed explanation of each practice you mentioned, **all important for ensuring quality in Agile development**:

---

### 1. **Shift-left testing**

* **What it is:** Moving testing activities earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC), ideally starting from the design and development phases instead of just at the end.
* **Why it matters:** Detecting defects early reduces cost and effort for fixing bugs.
* **How it works:** Developers write and run tests while coding (unit tests), and QA starts testing with early builds or mocks.

---

### 2. **TDD (Test-Driven Development), Unit + Integration Tests**

* **TDD:** Write a failing test first, then write code to pass the test, then refactor. Cycle repeats.
* **Unit tests:** Verify individual components or methods in isolation.
* **Integration tests:** Verify combined parts of the system work together.
* **Benefits:** Leads to better design, higher code coverage, and fewer bugs.

---

### 3. **Code reviews & Pair programming**

* **Code reviews:** Developers check each other’s code for errors, style, and logic before merging.
* **Pair programming:** Two developers work together on the same code, catching defects and sharing knowledge in real-time.
* **Impact:** Improves code quality, spreads domain knowledge, and reduces bugs early.

---

### 4. **CI/CD pipelines**

* **CI (Continuous Integration):** Developers merge code frequently to a shared repo; automated builds and tests run on each merge to catch issues early.
* **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment):** Automatically deploys the tested build to staging or production.
* **Purpose:** Ensures fast, reliable, and repeatable delivery of working software with quality checks embedded.

---

### 5. **Static analysis (e.g., SonarQube)**

* **Static code analysis:** Automated tools analyze source code for code smells, vulnerabilities, complexity, and standards compliance **without running the code**.
* **SonarQube:** Popular tool that integrates into CI pipelines and provides detailed reports.
* **Why:** Helps maintain code quality, security, and maintainability over time.

---

### 6. **Done criteria includes testing, code quality**

* The **Definition of Done (DoD)** is a checklist that ensures a story or task is truly complete.
* Beyond coding, it requires:

  * Passing unit and integration tests
  * Code reviewed and merged
  * Static analysis passed with no critical issues
  * Documentation updated if needed
  * Deployed to staging or demo environment
* This ensures that “done” means **production-ready**, not just “code written.”
