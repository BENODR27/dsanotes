| Boards  | Sprint backlog â†’ Done      | To Do â†’ In Progress â†’ Done |
| Metrics | Velocity                   | Lead time, Cycle time      |

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **6. What are the roles in Scrum?**

**Answer:**

1. **Product Owner (PO)** â€“ defines features and backlog
2. **Scrum Master** â€“ ensures the team follows Scrum
3. **Development Team** â€“ builds the product incrementally

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **7. What is a Sprint?**

**Answer:**
A time-boxed iteration (1-4 weeks) where a potentially shippable product increment is delivered. Each sprint starts with planning and ends with review and retrospective.

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **8. What is a User Story? Give an example.**

**Answer:**
A user story captures a requirement from an end-user's perspective.

Example:

> "As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can access my account if I forget it."

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **9. What is Definition of Done (DoD)?**

**Answer:**
A checklist that describes the criteria that a product increment must meet to be considered complete. It may include:

* Code complete
* Unit tested
* Reviewed and merged
* Deployed to staging
* Documented

---

### ðŸŸ¢ **10. What is Velocity in Agile?**

**Answer:**
Velocity is the average number of story points completed by the team in a sprint. It helps in sprint planning and forecasting.

---

## ðŸ”µ INTERMEDIATE/SCENARIO-BASED AGILE QUESTIONS

---

### ðŸ”¹ **11. How do you handle changing requirements mid-sprint?**

**Answer:**
Agile welcomes change, but within a sprint, change is minimized to avoid disruption. Major changes should be added to the **next sprint backlog** unless it's a critical bug or blocker.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **12. How do you estimate stories?**

**Answer:**
Using methods like:

* **Planning Poker**
* **T-shirt sizing**
* **Story Points** (based on complexity, effort, risk)

We compare stories relatively and use Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...).

---

### ðŸ”¹ **13. What if the team doesnâ€™t finish all stories in the Sprint?**

**Answer:**
Unfinished stories are moved back to the **product backlog** or reconsidered in the **next sprint planning**. The Scrum team discusses why and adapts in the retrospective.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **14. What is a Sprint Retrospective?**

**Answer:**
A ceremony at the end of the sprint where the team reflects on:

* What went well
* What didnâ€™t
* What can be improved

Example action item: "We will automate regression testing before the next sprint."

---

### ðŸ”¹ **15. What is the role of a Scrum Master in removing impediments?**

**Answer:**
Scrum Master identifies blockers (e.g., environment not ready, unclear requirements) and coordinates with stakeholders, infra teams, or PO to resolve them quickly.

---

## ðŸ”´ ADVANCED / LEAD-LEVEL AGILE QUESTIONS

---

### ðŸ”¹ **16. How do you ensure quality in Agile development?**

**Answer:**

* Shift-left testing
* TDD, unit + integration tests
* Code reviews & pair programming
* CI/CD pipelines
* Static analysis (e.g., SonarQube)
* Done criteria includes testing, code quality

---

### ðŸ”¹ **17. How do you handle technical debt in Agile?**

**Answer:**
We track tech debt in the backlog (as tech stories), allocate a portion of each sprint (\~20%) to refactoring, and prioritize based on impact and risk.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **18. How do you measure team performance in Agile?**

**Answer:**

* **Velocity trends**
* **Burn-down charts**
* **Lead time / Cycle time**
* **Retrospective improvements**
* **Customer feedback**

Never measure by individual outputâ€”focus is team delivery.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **19. What is backlog grooming/refinement?**

**Answer:**
A regular session where the team and PO:

* Clarify stories
* Add acceptance criteria
* Break down large epics
* Estimate effort
* Prioritize based on business value

---

### ðŸ”¹ **20. Whatâ€™s the difference between Epic, Feature, and Story?**

| Level   | Description                        |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Epic    | Large chunk of work, spans sprints |
| Feature | Functionality subset of an Epic    |
| Story   | User-level requirement             |

---

## ðŸ’¬ BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONS IN AGILE CONTEXT

---

### ðŸ”¹ **21. Describe a conflict you handled during Agile development.**

**Answer:**
"In Sprint 8, two developers disagreed on tech implementation. I facilitated a quick design discussion, reviewed pros/cons, and aligned with DoD and sprint goals to decide quickly. We resolved it without blocking the sprint."

---

### ðŸ”¹ **22. Have you led a retrospective? What actions came out of it?**

**Answer:**
"Yes, during one retro we found too many hotfixes were coming mid-sprint. We worked with the PO to create a separate backlog for critical bugs and implemented a buffer strategy."

---

### ðŸ”¹ **23. How do you manage dependencies in Agile?**

**Answer:**

* Identify dependencies early during backlog grooming
* Use dependency mapping or Kanban swimlanes
* Communicate across teams (Scrum of Scrums)
* Prioritize stories with external dependencies early

---

### ðŸ”¹ **24. Agile vs Waterfall â€“ which one is better and why?**

**Answer:**
Agile is better for projects with:

* Changing requirements
* Fast feedback loops
* Early and frequent delivery

Waterfall suits:

* Fixed-scope, fixed-budget
* Compliance-heavy domains

---

### ðŸ”¹ **25. How do you coach a team new to Agile?**

**Answer:**

* Introduce Scrum framework via workshops
* Set up tooling (JIRA, boards)
* Assign an experienced Scrum Master
* Start with short sprints and retros
* Monitor and adapt based on feedback
