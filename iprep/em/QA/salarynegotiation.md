Here’s a professional step-by-step **salary negotiation plan** tailored for Emirates Group IT:

---

## 🧾 Step 1: Understand Salary Expectations in UAE

| Role                       | Experience  | Monthly Salary (AED) | INR Equivalent (\~22 INR/AED) |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| SDE (Mid-Level)            | 5–8 years   | 15,000 – 22,000 AED  | ₹3.3L – ₹5L                   |
| Senior Software Engineer   | 8–12 years  | 20,000 – 28,000 AED  | ₹4.4L – ₹6.2L                 |
| Technical Lead / Architect | 10–15 years | 28,000 – 40,000 AED  | ₹6.2L – ₹8.8L                 |

> ✅ Your target of **₹5,00,000/month** (\~22K AED) is **justified for 8–12 years of strong experience** especially if you bring fullstack, cloud, microservices, and leadership skills.

## 🧠 Step 2: Prepare a Strong Justification

### 📌 Justify with Market Research

* **Dubai IT salary reports** (Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, GulfTalent)
* Benchmark Emirates Group IT salaries (typically **15K–30K AED** for strong SDEs)

**Example Statement:**

> “Based on UAE market research and roles similar to the Emirates Group SDE, the expected salary for someone with my experience ranges between AED 20,000–25,000. Given my 8+ years of enterprise experience in microservices, Spring Boot, and frontend frameworks, I believe my expectations align with the market.”

---

### 📌 Highlight Your Unique Value

* Experience with **Java, Spring Boot, Microservices**
* Real-world **OpenShift, Kafka, DevOps** experience
* Airline or logistics domain (if any)
* Willingness to relocate + long-term stability

**Example Statement:**

> “I have contributed to scalable production-grade applications, led microservice architecture initiatives, and have hands-on DevOps exposure with CI/CD pipelines, which I believe aligns well with Emirates Group IT’s digital transformation journey.”

---

## 🗣️ Step 3: Negotiation Strategy

### ✅ When HR asks: *“What are your expectations?”*

**Say:**

> “Based on my research and the cost of living in UAE, I’m looking at a range of **AED 22,000 to 25,000 per month** plus benefits. I’m flexible depending on the total package and growth opportunities.”

💡 Don’t anchor with your current salary (₹85K) – focus on **value + market rate**, not past geography.

---

### ❌ Avoid Saying:

* “I need a 5x raise”
* “My current salary is low, so I want to make up for it”
* “I’ll accept anything, I just want the job”
