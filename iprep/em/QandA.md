### 🧠 **MOCK INTERVIEW SIMULATION – TECHNICAL & SCENARIO ROUND**

---

### ✅ **1. Explain your approach to designing a Java-based microservice architecture.**

**Answer:**
"When designing a Java-based microservice architecture, I start by identifying business capabilities and mapping them to individual services (bounded contexts). I use **Spring Boot** for rapid development and **Spring Cloud** components like Config Server and Eureka (if service discovery is needed).

Each service has:

* **Independent DB** (Database per Service pattern – usually Oracle or Couchbase).
* Communicates via **REST** or **event-based** messaging (e.g., **Solace** or **Kafka**).
* Uses **JWT/OAuth2** for security.
* Exposed and documented via **OpenAPI/Swagger**.
* Deployed using **Docker + Kubernetes/OpenShift**.
* Monitored via **AppDynamics, Splunk**, and logs are correlated using trace IDs."

---

### ✅ **2. How do you handle inter-service communication and fallbacks?**

**Answer:**
"I prefer **REST** for synchronous and **Solace/Kafka** for asynchronous communication. For REST calls, I implement **Resilience4j** with:

* **Circuit Breakers** for fault isolation.
* **Retry and Timeout** for transient faults.
* **Rate Limiting** to avoid abuse.
* **Fallback methods** to provide default behavior.
  All fallbacks are logged and monitored. For async comms, I use DLQs and message reprocessing strategies."

---

### ✅ **3. Can you walk me through a CI/CD pipeline you’ve implemented?**

**Answer:**
"Sure. For a Spring Boot + React project, I used **Jenkins**:

1. **Git trigger** initiates the pipeline on PR or merge.
2. **Build phase** runs Maven for Java and NPM for React.
3. **Unit tests** using JUnit + Mockito and Jest + Karma.
4. **SonarQube** for code quality, **ShiftLeft** for security scan.
5. **Docker image** is built and pushed to a private registry.
6. **Kubernetes YAML** is applied for OpenShift deployment.
7. **Smoke test** runs post-deployment, then AppDynamics monitors the environment."

---

### ✅ **4. How do you ensure observability in your microservices?**

**Answer:**
"I use:

* **Structured logging** via SLF4J + MDC (to track correlation IDs).
* **AppDynamics** for APM (response times, DB calls, errors).
* **Custom Prometheus metrics** exposed via Actuator.
* Alerts via **Grafana** dashboards or Splunk anomaly detection.
  We use these tools in conjunction to monitor health, performance, and detect anomalies in real-time."

---

### ✅ **5. How would you refactor legacy monoliths into microservices at Emirates?**

**Answer:**
"I would use the **Strangler Fig Pattern**:

* Start by identifying core modules (e.g., booking, check-in).
* Build new microservices using Spring Boot and gradually route calls to them via an API Gateway.
* Use **domain events** to sync data between new services and the monolith.
* Ensure **database decoupling** and **data consistency** using eventual consistency (via Solace or CDC).
* Deploy incrementally and monitor impact at each step."

---

### ✅ **6. How do you debug a production issue with high latency on a booking API?**

**Answer:**

1. Check **APM (AppDynamics)** – latency trends, slow transactions.
2. Review **logs (via Splunk)** for exceptions or slow DB queries.
3. Analyze **thread dumps** and DB metrics.
4. Use **OpenTelemetry trace logs** to trace inter-service calls.
5. Check if any **circuit breakers** are open or if retries are piling up.
6. Apply hotfix if needed, else rollback via CI/CD.

---

### ✅ **7. How do you ensure backward compatibility in APIs?**

**Answer:**

* Use **versioning** (e.g., /v1/bookings).
* Avoid removing or renaming fields abruptly.
* Introduce new fields as optional with defaults.
* Maintain old versions until consumers migrate.
* Document APIs via **OpenAPI**, and use **contract testing** (e.g., Pact).

---

### ✅ **8. How do you handle secrets in your deployments?**

**Answer:**
"I never store secrets in code. I use:

* **Kubernetes/OpenShift Secrets**
* **HashiCorp Vault** (or AWS Secrets Manager)
* Jenkins uses **credentials bindings** for secure usage.
* Secrets are rotated and access is managed via RBAC."

---

### ✅ **9. How do you manage code quality in a team setup?**

**Answer:**

* Enforce **branching strategy** (Git Flow or trunk-based).
* Use **mandatory code reviews** via pull requests.
* Integrate **SonarQube + Unit Testing** into the pipeline.
* Use **JIRA + Confluence** for traceability and documentation.
* Mentor juniors on clean code principles, SOLID, and refactoring.

---

### ✅ **10. What would you do if a junior developer's code caused a production outage?**

**Answer:**
"I would take ownership of the fix, support the team to restore services, and then perform a root cause analysis. Post-incident, I’d coach the junior dev on what went wrong in a supportive way and suggest guardrails like pairing, better PR reviews, and CI validations to prevent recurrence."

* **Consistency**: Use optimistic locking and distributed transactions (Saga pattern)
* **Payment**: Idempotent APIs + retry + timeout fallback

> "For booking concurrency, I would use row-level locking or Redis with atomic operations. The booking service would reserve a seat for a limited window (e.g., 10 minutes). If payment isn't completed, a background job releases it."

---

### ✅ **2. How would you design an API rate-limiting solution for Emirates’ public APIs?**

**Expectations:**

* Prevent abuse
* Different tiers for users (Free vs Premium)

**Sample Answer:**

**Approach:**

* At the **API Gateway**, implement token bucket or leaky bucket algorithm.
* **Redis** to store per-user token counts with TTL.
* Use **JWT claims** to determine tier (e.g., X requests/min for free, Y for premium).
* Return 429 “Too Many Requests” with `Retry-After` headers.
* Include **Rate-Limit headers** for transparency.

> “I’d use OpenAPI + Spring Security filters to validate JWT scopes and apply limits per endpoint group. This ensures Emirates’ APIs are protected without impacting premium partners.”

---

### ✅ **3. Design a real-time baggage tracking system.**

**Expectations:**

* Track location updates from airport devices
* Notify users in mobile app

**Sample Answer:**

**Architecture:**

* **IoT Devices/Scanners** push updates to **MQTT broker** or via **Solace/Kafka**.
* A **Tracking Service** subscribes and updates a **time-series DB** or **NoSQL** like MongoDB.
* **Mobile App** subscribes to WebSocket or Firebase for push updates.
* **Geo-spatial index** for real-time baggage location.

> "I’d use Spring Boot with WebFlux for reactive updates and deploy using Kubernetes with rolling updates to maintain uptime."

---

### ✅ **4. How would you design a highly available and fault-tolerant microservices system?**

**Key Principles:**

* **Load balancing** with retries and timeouts
* **Circuit breakers (Resilience4J)**
* **Service discovery** using Consul or DNS
* **Stateless services** (scale horizontally)
* **Health checks** for auto-healing in Kubernetes
* **Failover regions** (if using AWS/GCP)

> “I’d make each service independently deployable and ensure failure in one service doesn’t cascade—using async messaging and fallback methods for robustness.”

---

### ✅ **5. Design a scalable notification system for Emirates (SMS/Email/App Push).**

**Answer Outline:**

* Accepts notification jobs via REST or async message.
* Queue jobs via Solace or Kafka.
* Worker pool picks and sends notifications (e.g., via Twilio, SendGrid, Firebase).
* Use **Outbox pattern** for guaranteed delivery.
* Notification preferences stored per user.

> “Each type of notification (SMS, Email, Push) is modularized. I use retries with exponential backoff and Dead Letter Queues for failures.”

---

### ✅ **6. How do you handle schema changes in a microservices environment (Zero Downtime)?**

**Best Practices:**

* **Backward-compatible DB changes**: Add nullable fields, avoid renaming/removing columns
* Use **feature flags** and **blue-green deployments**
* **Dual write/read strategy** during migration
