## ‚úàÔ∏è Operating Systems & Platforms Used in Emirates Flights

### üõ´ **In-Flight Systems (Cabin & Cockpit Tech)**

These are primarily embedded, real-time systems running on certified aviation-grade platforms.

| System                                        | OS Used                                                    | Purpose                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IFE (In-Flight Entertainment)** ‚Äì ICE       | **Embedded Linux**, **Android-based subsystems**, **RTOS** | Runs passenger entertainment, seat-back apps, and cabin crew interface |
| **Cabin Management System (CMS)**             | **VxWorks**, **QNX**, or **RTEMS**                         | Lighting, temperature, announcements, seat control                     |
| **Aircraft Data Communication & Monitoring**  | **Proprietary OS**, **RTOS**, or **ARINC 653**             | Flight data monitoring, telemetry, engine performance                  |
| **Wi-Fi & Connectivity (OnAir or Panasonic)** | **Linux-based systems** on custom aircraft routers         | In-flight Wi-Fi, satellite communication control                       |
| **Electronic Flight Bag (EFB)**               | **Windows 10**, **iPadOS**, **Android**                    | Pilot use: flight plans, manuals, checklists (on Surface Pro or iPad)  |

## üßë‚Äçüíª Programming Languages Used in Emirates Flight-Related Applications

### üí° Embedded / Onboard Systems (Airplane Level)

* **C/C++** ‚Äì For all real-time firmware in flight hardware
* **Ada** ‚Äì Used in avionics due to safety certifications
* **Python** ‚Äì For test harnesses, data validation, ML post-flight analytics
* **Java/Kotlin** ‚Äì Android-based seat-back UI and IFE systems
* **JavaScript** ‚Äì For browser-based passenger UI in newer IFE systems

## üåê Emirates Ground & Enterprise Systems (Connected to Flights)

### ‚úÖ Emirates Group IT Stack (as per job description)

Used for enterprise apps, mobile/web check-in, crew management, and booking systems:

| Layer            | Technologies Used                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backend**      | Java 11‚Äì17, Spring Boot, Python 3.7+, Node.js                  |
| **Frontend**     | React.js, Angular (legacy support), HTML5                      |
| **Databases**    | Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Couchbase, ElasticSearch       |
| **APIs**         | REST, SOAP, OpenAPI Spec                                       |
| **Integration**  | Solace (Pub/Sub), SnapLogic, Informatica                       |
| **DevOps/Infra** | Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, Jenkins, SonarQube, AppDynamics |
| **Cloud**        | AWS, Azure, Google Cloud (hybrid)                              |

### Examples:

* **Booking System**: Java + Oracle + Spring Boot microservices
* **Check-in App**: React.js frontend + Java backend + Kafka/Redis for state
* **Crew Scheduling**: Node.js or Java, integrated with legacy ALCS and Oracle
* **Flight Tracker Dashboard**: Angular + Python APIs + ElasticSearch
