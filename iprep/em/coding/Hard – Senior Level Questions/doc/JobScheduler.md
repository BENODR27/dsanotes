Let's walk through the **Job Scheduler with Cooldown Period** problem in **Java 8**, and explain the code **step-by-step like you're new to this**.

---

## 🔧 Problem Statement

You're given:

- An array of tasks represented by **characters** (like `['A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'C']`)
- A **cooldown period `n`**, meaning the same task must be executed at least `n` intervals apart.

### ⏱️ Goal:

Return the **minimum number of time units** (including idle time) to finish all tasks.

---

## 🧠 Example

```text
Input: tasks = ['A','A','A','B','B','B'], n = 2
Output: 8

Explanation:
A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
```

You need a break of 2 units between the same task.

## ✅ Java 8 Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class JobScheduler {
    public int leastInterval(char[] tasks, int n) {
        // Step 1: Count frequency of each task
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        for (char task : tasks) {
            freq[task - 'A']++;
        }

        // Step 2: Sort frequencies in descending order
        Arrays.sort(freq);
        int maxFreq = freq[25] - 1; // most frequent task, minus 1 (last task doesn’t need trailing idle)
        int idleSlots = maxFreq * n;

        // Step 3: Fill idle slots with remaining tasks
        for (int i = 24; i >= 0 && freq[i] > 0; i--) {
            idleSlots -= Math.min(freq[i], maxFreq);
        }

        // Step 4: Return total length (tasks + remaining idle slots)
        return idleSlots > 0 ? idleSlots + tasks.length : tasks.length;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JobScheduler scheduler = new JobScheduler();
        char[] tasks = {'A','A','A','B','B','B'};
        int n = 2;
        System.out.println("Minimum intervals: " + scheduler.leastInterval(tasks, n));  // Output: 8
    }
}
```

## 🧸 Step-by-Step Explanation (Like You’re New to It)

### Step 1: Count Task Frequencies

Imagine you're sorting toys (A, B, C). Count how many of each you have.

```java
int[] freq = new int[26];
for (char task : tasks) {
    freq[task - 'A']++;
}
```

So for `['A','A','A','B','B','B']`, you’ll get:

```java
freq['A' - 'A'] = 3
freq['B' - 'A'] = 3
```

### Step 2: Sort and Focus on the Most Frequent Task

Sort the frequency array:

```java
Arrays.sort(freq);
```

Now the most frequent task is at the **end**: `freq[25]`

```java
maxFreq = 3 - 1 = 2   // Why -1? The last A doesn't need trailing idle
```

### Step 3: Calculate Idle Slots Needed

If A appears 3 times and `n = 2`, you need:

```
A _ _ A _ _ A
```

→ You need 2 gaps between A’s → 2 \* n = **4 idle slots**

```java
idleSlots = maxFreq * n = 2 * 2 = 4
```

### Step 4: Fill Idle Slots With Other Tasks

Now try to put B’s or C’s into those idle slots.

For each other task:

```java
idleSlots -= min(freq[i], maxFreq);
```

B appears 3 times → subtract 2 (not 3, because you only have 2 places between A’s)

Now idleSlots = 4 - 2 = 2

Another task like C = 1 → subtract 1 more.

Keep doing this until idleSlots is 0 or negative.

### Step 5: Result

If idleSlots > 0:

```java
return idleSlots + tasks.length;
```

Else:

```java
return tasks.length;
```

## 📈 Time & Space Complexity

| Measure          | Value                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| Time Complexity  | O(N) + O(26 log 26) ≈ O(N) |
| Space Complexity | O(1) – only 26 letters     |
