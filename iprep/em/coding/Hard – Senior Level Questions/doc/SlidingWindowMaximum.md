Let's walk through the **Sliding Window Maximum** problem step-by-step using **Java 8**, and I’ll explain it like you're learning for the first time — clear and simple.

## ✅ Problem: Sliding Window Maximum

**You are given an array of integers `nums`, and a window size `k`.**
Slide the window from left to right over the array, and **at each step, return the maximum value inside the window.**

---

### 🔍 Example:

```java
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
```

### Explanation:

Windows are:

- \[1, 3, -1] → max = 3
- \[3, -1, -3] → max = 3
- \[-1, -3, 5] → max = 5
- \[-3, 5, 3] → max = 5
- \[5, 3, 6] → max = 6
- \[3, 6, 7] → max = 7

## 🚀 Java 8 Code (Efficient using Deque)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SlidingWindowMaximum {
    public int[] maxSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {
        if (nums == null || k <= 0) return new int[0];
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] result = new int[n - k + 1];
        Deque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<>(); // stores indexes

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // 1. Remove elements not in the current window
            if (!deque.isEmpty() && deque.peek() < i - k + 1) {
                deque.poll(); // remove index from front
            }

            // 2. Remove smaller values from the back (not useful)
            while (!deque.isEmpty() && nums[deque.peekLast()] < nums[i]) {
                deque.pollLast(); // remove from back
            }

            // 3. Add current element index
            deque.offer(i);

            // 4. Store result from the front of deque (max in current window)
            if (i >= k - 1) {
                result[i - k + 1] = nums[deque.peek()];
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Explanation (Like to a Child)

Imagine you're looking out a window that can only see `k` buildings at a time, and you're always asked:

> “What’s the **tallest** building in this window?”

To do this **fast**, we use a **magic trick** called a `Deque` (Double Ended Queue), which helps us track **only the most important buildings**.

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Ignore Old Buildings

If a building **left the window**, we remove its index from the front.

```java
if (!deque.isEmpty() && deque.peek() < i - k + 1) {
    deque.poll();
}
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Remove Smaller Buildings (Behind the Current)

Why? Because they can **never be the tallest again** if something taller is here.

```java
while (!deque.isEmpty() && nums[deque.peekLast()] < nums[i]) {
    deque.pollLast();
}
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Add New Building Index

We always add the **current building's index** to the back.

```java
deque.offer(i);
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: When the Window is Full, Record the Maximum

The **front of the deque always holds the tallest** (biggest number) in current window.

```java
if (i >= k - 1) {
    result[i - k + 1] = nums[deque.peek()];
}
```

---

## 🧪 Dry Run Example

Given:

```java
nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
```

- i = 0 → Add 1
- i = 1 → Remove 1 (because 3 is bigger), Add 3
- i = 2 → Add -1
  → Window: \[1,3,-1] → max = 3
  → deque: indexes of \[3, -1]

Repeat the above for the rest of the array.

## 🎓 Final Thoughts

| Concept      | Description                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `Deque`      | Used to keep only useful indexes (not values) |
| `poll()`     | Removes from front (oldest index)             |
| `pollLast()` | Removes smaller values from back              |
| `offer(i)`   | Add current index                             |
| `peek()`     | See the index of the max value in window      |
