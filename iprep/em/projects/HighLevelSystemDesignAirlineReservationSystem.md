## ✅ 2. **Non-Functional Requirements**

* High availability
* Scalability (handle peak traffic during holidays)
* Consistency (prevent double bookings)
* Security (PCI-DSS for payments)
* Observability (monitoring & logging)

## ✅ 4. **Microservices Breakdown**

| Service             | Responsibility                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Search Service**  | Query available flights from Inventory                  |
| **Booking Service** | Handle seat reservations, locking, PNR generation       |
| **Payment Service** | Interact with external gateway (Stripe, Razorpay, etc.) |
| **Notification**    | Email/SMS ticket confirmations, cancellation notices    |
| **Auth Service**    | Login, JWT tokens, OAuth2, RBAC                         |
| **User Service**    | Passenger details, history, loyalty status              |
| **Admin Portal**    | Manage flights, prices, routes, schedules               |
| **Loyalty Service** | Points calculation and redemption                       |

---

## ✅ 5. **Databases**

| DB Name          | Purpose                         | Technology            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `FlightDB`       | Flight schedules, seats, routes | PostgreSQL / MySQL    |
| `BookingDB`      | PNRs, reservations, statuses    | PostgreSQL + Redis    |
| `UserDB`         | Passenger profiles              | MongoDB or PostgreSQL |
| `LoyaltyDB`      | Miles and redemption history    | MongoDB or Cassandra  |
| `Logs/Analytics` | Logging, dashboards             | Elasticsearch, Kibana |

## ✅ 6. **Key Design Decisions**

| Challenge               | Solution                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prevent Double Bookings | Use distributed lock via Redis or DB transaction isolation |
| Scalability             | Stateless services behind load balancers                   |
| Data Consistency        | Use Saga Pattern for payment & booking coordination        |
| Resilience              | Circuit Breaker (Resilience4J/Hystrix), Retry Logic        |
| Real-time Updates       | Kafka/WebSocket for sea`t availability updates              |
| Observability           | Prometheus + Grafana, ELK stack                            |

---

## ✅ 7. **Workflow: Flight Booking Flow**

1. User searches flights via **Search Service**.
2. Chooses a flight, hits **Booking Service**.
3. Booking service locks seat (Redis), generates temporary PNR.
4. **Payment Service** is invoked – payment processed securely.
5. On payment success → PNR is confirmed, ticket issued.
6. **Notification Service** sends email/SMS.
7. Loyalty service credits points to user.

## ✅ 8. **Tech Stack**

| Layer           | Technologies                                   |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend        | React / Angular / Vue                          |
| Backend         | Spring Boot Microservices                      |
| Auth            | Spring Security + OAuth2 / Keycloak            |
| DB              | PostgreSQL / Redis / MongoDB                   |
| Messaging Queue | Kafka / RabbitMQ (for booking events)          |
| Observability   | ELK Stack, Prometheus + Grafana, Splunk        |
| Deployment      | Docker + Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS), Helm charts |
| CI/CD           | GitHub Actions / Jenkins / ArgoCD              |

---

## ✅ 9. **Security Best Practices**

* Use HTTPS & secure API Gateway
* JWT for stateless auth
* Input validation & sanitization
* Role-based access for admin vs passenger
* PCI-DSS compliant payment

---

## ✅ 10. **Optional Add-ons**

| Feature                 | Approach                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Seat map UI             | Real-time availability via WebSocket              |
| Real-time delay updates | Integrate with 3rd party APIs (e.g., FlightAware) |
| Multi-language support  | i18n support at frontend/backend                  |
| Offline booking system  | Sync with central DB via Kafka                    |
