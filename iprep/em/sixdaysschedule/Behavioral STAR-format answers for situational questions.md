Here are **8 Behavioral Interview Questions** with **STAR-format answers** tailored specifically for Emirates Group IT's **Senior Software Engineer** role:

---

### ✅ 1. **Tell me about a time you faced a production issue. How did you handle it?**

**S – Situation:**
We had a microservice outage in the customer booking system during peak travel hours.

**T – Task:**
I was the on-call engineer responsible for identifying and resolving the issue within SLA.

**A – Action:**
I quickly checked Splunk logs and dashboards via AppDynamics. I found that a downstream service had crashed due to a memory leak. I triggered a rollback from Jenkins, and applied a feature flag to route traffic to a fallback version. Then, I worked with the team to hotfix the leak, tested with JUnit and Mockito, and redeployed.

**R – Result:**
The system was restored in 15 minutes with no booking loss. My rapid response and rollback strategy prevented potential revenue loss. The incident report I submitted was later used in our internal DevOps playbook.

### ✅ 2. **Describe a situation where you improved a system’s performance.**

**S – Situation:**
Our baggage tracking system had performance issues under load.

**T – Task:**
Improve the response time of the service by optimizing the backend.

**A – Action:**
I analyzed metrics in AppDynamics and discovered high latency from complex DB joins. I refactored queries, introduced indexes, and used Redis caching for frequently accessed data. I also migrated the service to a more scalable OpenShift pod configuration.

**R – Result:**
Latency dropped by 60%, and throughput increased from 300 to 800 requests/second. Emirates' quality metrics were exceeded, and I received internal recognition.

### ✅ 3. **Give an example of working with a cross-functional team.**

**S – Situation:**
We were launching a new check-in system module that required coordination between frontend, backend, and infrastructure teams.

**T – Task:**
Ensure backend services were delivered on time and integrated smoothly.

**A – Action:**
I held daily syncs with the React.js frontend team to finalize REST API contracts. I created Swagger documentation and contract tests using Pact. I also worked with DevOps to ensure CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins were tested and deployed on Kubernetes.

**R – Result:**
The new check-in module launched without integration issues, and customer feedback was positive. This collaboration model was adopted in later projects.

### ✅ 4. **Tell me about a time when you had to learn a new technology quickly.**

**S – Situation:**
A new project required integrating Solace for real-time baggage updates.

**T – Task:**
Learn and implement Solace message queues with Spring Boot in under 2 weeks.

**A – Action:**
I studied the official documentation, joined Solace developer forums, and created a proof-of-concept. I then implemented producers and consumers using Spring Cloud Stream and ensured all message flows were logged and monitored via Splunk.

**R – Result:**
The integration was deployed successfully and used as a reference implementation for future teams. My learning initiative was appreciated by senior architects.

### ✅ 5. **Describe a time when you had a conflict with a teammate. How did you resolve it?**

**S – Situation:**
A frontend engineer insisted on changing API structure late in the sprint, risking delays.

**T – Task:**
Resolve the conflict while maintaining delivery timelines and team harmony.

**A – Action:**
I scheduled a quick call to understand the reasoning. We reviewed the API schema and agreed to version the endpoint to avoid breaking changes. I updated the OpenAPI spec and coordinated dual support temporarily.

**R – Result:**
We avoided production impact and preserved the working relationship. The team appreciated the compromise and agile approach.

### ✅ 6. **Have you ever had to refactor legacy code?**

**S – Situation:**
I was assigned to maintain a monolithic flight scheduling system that hadn’t been touched in years.

**T – Task:**
Stabilize and prepare it for migration to microservices.

**A – Action:**
I began by writing integration and unit tests to ensure behavior was preserved. Then, I modularized the code, removed redundant logic, and added SonarQube analysis to catch code smells. I containerized the service with Docker for isolated testing.

**R – Result:**
The system became stable with 85% code coverage, and I successfully broke it down into 3 microservices. The team used my documentation as a reference for further decomposition.

---

### ✅ 7. **Tell me about a time you missed a deadline.**

**S – Situation:**
I underestimated the complexity of an integration with an external payment gateway.

**T – Task:**
Deliver the integration in 2 weeks, which ended up taking 3.

**A – Action:**
I informed the PO immediately and provided a revised estimate. I then broke the work into smaller deliverables, parallelized testing with QA, and automated most regression cases using JUnit and Postman.

**R – Result:**
While it was delivered a week late, the quality was high, and we had no post-deployment issues. I later contributed to improving our estimation process during sprint planning.

---

### ✅ 8. **Describe a project where you implemented security best practices.**

**S – Situation:**
Our customer portal had to meet new GDPR and PCI compliance standards.

**T – Task:**
Implement secure coding practices and ensure proper logging, encryption, and access control.

**A – Action:**
I applied field-level encryption for sensitive fields, implemented HTTPS everywhere, used OWASP recommendations for input sanitization, and integrated ShiftLeft static analysis into our CI pipeline. I also configured secure log masking for tokens and passwords.

**R – Result:**
We passed the security audit with zero critical issues. My secure coding practices were adopted across the department.
