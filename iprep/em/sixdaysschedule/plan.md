## 🗓️ 6-Day Interview Preparation Plan for Emirates Group IT – Senior Software Engineer

> 💡 Goal: To prepare comprehensively across technical (Java backend + React + cloud + DevOps), behavioral, and Emirates-specific expectations.

---

### ✅ **Day 1: JD Deep-Dive + Core Java 8+ + Design Patterns**

#### 🔹 JD Analysis & Strategy

- Understand **Emirates business domains** (aviation, cargo, operations).
- List all **keywords from the JD** to prepare bullet-wise.

#### 🔹 Java 8+ Concepts (must master)

- Functional interfaces, Streams API, Lambdas.
- Optional, DateTime API, CompletableFuture.

✔️ Practice: -https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-pattern-programs/ -opt

- Java 8 Stream problems (e.g., groupBy, map/filter/reduce).
- Write `Employee` and `FlightBooking` domain-based problems.

#### 🔹 Core OOP + Design Patterns

- Singleton, Factory, Builder, Strategy, Observer.
- Focus on how they apply to Spring Boot microservices.

📚 Resource: Clean Code (Chapter 1–3) + GeeksforGeeks Java patterns.

### ✅ **Day 2: Spring Boot + REST + Microservices + Security**

#### 🔹 Spring Core

- Dependency Injection, @Component, @Autowired, @Qualifier.

#### 🔹 Spring Boot + REST APIs

- Build a CRUD app for `FlightSchedule`.
- Add exception handling (`@ControllerAdvice`).

#### 🔹 Microservices Concepts

- Service Discovery, Config Server, API Gateway.
- Circuit Breaker (Hystrix or Resilience4J).

#### 🔹 Spring Security (Basic + JWT)

- Stateless JWT authentication + Role-based access control.

✔️ Build:

- Mini airline backend (e.g., `CheckInService`, `PassengerService`) as microservices with REST APIs and JWT auth.

---

### ✅ **Day 3: ReactJS + Docker + CI/CD**

#### 🔹 ReactJS Core (based on JD)

- Components (Functional), Props, State, Hooks (useEffect, useState).
- Axios for API calls, form validation.

✔️ Task:

- Build a UI that fetches and displays `flight schedule` via REST API.

#### 🔹 Docker & CI/CD

- Write Dockerfile for Java + React apps.
- Understand Jenkins + Git + Maven pipeline structure.

✔️ Practice:

- Build and run both apps in Docker containers.
- Simulate CI/CD (GitHub Actions or Jenkins).

---

### ✅ **Day 4: Database + DevOps Tools + Testing**

#### 🔹 Database

- Practice SQL (Joins, Indexing, Views, Triggers) – Postgres/MySQL/Oracle.
- NoSQL (MongoDB basics + sample aggregation pipeline).

#### 🔹 DevOps Stack from JD

- Jenkins: Freestyle vs Declarative Pipelines.
- Docker + Kubernetes (deployment YAMLs, `kubectl` commands).
- Openshift overview.

#### 🔹 Testing

- JUnit5 + Mockito (`when(...)`, `@Mock`, `@InjectMocks`).
- Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library basics.

✔️ Practice:

- Write unit tests for a Spring Boot REST controller + Mockito tests for service layer.

---

### ✅ **Day 5: Cloud + Integration + Logging & Monitoring**

#### 🔹 Cloud Basics (AWS/GCP/Azure)

- EC2, S3, IAM, RDS (AWS).
- How to deploy Spring Boot to cloud.

#### 🔹 Integration (from JD)

- Solace (Pub/Sub concept).
- Snaplogic/Informatica overview.
- API Gateway (APIGee basics).

#### 🔹 Logging & Monitoring

- Add logging using SLF4J, integrate with **Splunk**.
- Add metrics + health check using **Actuator**.
- AppDynamics overview.

---

### ✅ **Day 6: Mock Interviews + HR Questions + Emirates Research**

#### 🔹 Mock Interview: Technical

- Ask a friend or use AI to simulate a backend + frontend interview.
- Focus on Emirates-like domains: aviation, crew mgmt, cargo ops.

#### 🔹 HR/Behavioral Questions

- Why Emirates?
- Tell me about a production incident.
- Time when you led a tech initiative.
- Conflict resolution in a team.

✔️ Prepare STAR format answers.

#### 🔹 Emirates Group Research

- Understand Emirates IT landscape.
- Latest innovations (e.g., biometric boarding, smart gates).
- Prepare a question to ask interviewer.
