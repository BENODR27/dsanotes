    - Sets (`HashSet`, `TreeSet`)
    - Maps (`HashMap`, `TreeMap`, `LinkedHashMap`)
    - Queues (`PriorityQueue`, `Deque`)
  - **Strings:**
    - String manipulation (`substring`, `split`, `replace`, etc.)
    - StringBuilder vs StringBuffer
  - **Concurrency:**
    - Threads, Runnable, Callable
    - Synchronization, Locks, Atomic Variables

  - Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST)
  - Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
  - Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA), Height of a Tree
- **Graphs:**
  - Representations (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)
  - Traversal Algorithms (BFS, DFS)
  - Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
- **Hash Tables:**
  - Hashing basics, Collision Resolution
  - Problems like Two Sum, Group Anagrams

##### **B. Algorithms**
- **Sorting and Searching:**
  - QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort
  - Binary Search, Ternary Search
- **Dynamic Programming:**
  - Fibonacci, Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
  - Coin Change, Edit Distance
- **Greedy Algorithms:**
  - Activity Selection, Fractional Knapsack
- **Backtracking:**
  - N-Queens, Sudoku Solver
- **Recursion:**
  - Understand recursion trees and base cases
  - Problems like Tower of Hanoi, Permutations

##### **C. Practice Platforms**
- LeetCode (use the "Java" tag for solutions)
- HackerRank (focus on "Algorithms" and "Data Structures")
- Codeforces (participate in contests for timed practice)

#### **3. System Design**
FAANG interviews often include a system design round. Here’s how to prepare:

- **Key Concepts:**
  - Scalability, Load Balancing, Caching
  - Database Design (SQL vs NoSQL, Indexing, Sharding)
  - Microservices Architecture
  - CAP Theorem, Consistency Models
- **Common Systems to Study:**
  - URL Shortener
  - Twitter Clone
  - File Sharing Service
  - Chat Application
- **Java-Specific Considerations:**
  - Use Java frameworks like Spring Boot for designing APIs.
  - Understand Java's concurrency model for handling high traffic.
- **Resources:**
  - Grokking the System Design Interview (Educative.io)
  - System Design Primer (GitHub Repository)
  - High Scalability Blog

#### **4. Behavioral Questions**
Behavioral questions assess your soft skills and cultural fit. Prepare using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).

- **Common Questions:**
  - Tell me about a time when you faced a difficult challenge at work.
  - How do you handle conflicts in a team?
  - Describe a project you led and its impact.
- **Java-Specific Context:**
  - Be ready to discuss projects where you used Java for backend development, multithreading, or large-scale systems.
- **Resources:**
  - Glassdoor reviews for company-specific behavioral questions
  - Interview Cake’s behavioral question guide

---

#### **5. Mock Interviews**
Mock interviews are crucial for simulating real interview conditions. Use these platforms:

- **Coding Mock Interviews:**
  - Pramp (peer-to-peer mock interviews)
  - Interviewing.io (anonymously practice with engineers from top companies)
- **System Design Mock Interviews:**
  - Exponent (system design practice platform)
  - Gainlo (mock interviews with FAANG engineers)

#### **6. Weekly Study Plan**
Here’s a sample weekly plan to keep you on track:

| Day       | Focus Area               | Activities                                                                 |

#### **7. Additional Tips**
- **Optimize Your Code:**
  - Always consider time and space complexity.
  - Use Java's built-in libraries effectively (e.g., `Collections`, `Stream`).
- **Write Clean Code:**
  - Follow Java naming conventions.
  - Write modular, reusable code.
- **Stay Updated:**
  - Keep up with the latest Java versions and features (e.g., Java 17, Records, Pattern Matching).
- **Practice Regularly:**
  - Consistency is key. Aim to solve at least 5 problems per day.
