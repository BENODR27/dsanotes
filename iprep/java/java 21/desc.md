## âœ… **Java 21 (2023) â€“ Key Features and Enhancements**

### ðŸ”¶ **1. Record Patterns (Final) â€“ JEP 405**

> **Record Patterns** are now a stable feature in Java 21, improving how `instanceof` and `switch` can be used with records.

- **Description:** Record patterns are used in pattern matching for `instanceof` and `switch` expressions, making it easier to work with record types directly.

**Example:**

```java
record Point(int x, int y) {}

static void printPoint(Object obj) {
    if (obj instanceof Point(int x, int y)) {
        System.out.println("Point: " + x + ", " + y);
    }
}
```

- **Use Case:** Simplifies the logic for destructuring records and enhances readability when working with complex data structures.

---

### ðŸ”¶ **2. Virtual Threads (Final) â€“ JEP 425**

> Virtual threads, introduced as a preview feature in Java 19 and now fully stabilized, help improve concurrency with minimal resources.

- **Description:** Virtual threads provide a lightweight, scalable way to handle concurrency, ideal for high-concurrency applications that require thousands of threads.

**Example:**

```java
Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("Virtual Thread: " + Thread.currentThread());
Thread.startVirtualThread(task);
```

- **Use Case:** Applications that require high concurrency (e.g., web servers, microservices) can benefit from reduced memory overhead and simplified threading.

---

### ðŸ”¶ **3. Foreign Function & Memory API (Final) â€“ JEP 419**

> **Project Panama** continues to evolve, with Java 21 stabilizing the API for interacting with native code and memory.

- **Description:** This API provides a safer and more efficient way to interact with native code, manage off-heap memory, and access native libraries without needing JNI (Java Native Interface).

**Example:**

```java
try (var arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var memorySegment = arena.allocate(100);
    memorySegment.set(0, (byte) 100); // Direct memory access
    System.out.println(memorySegment.get(0));
}
```

- **Use Case:** Ideal for applications that need low-level memory management or direct interaction with native libraries (e.g., game engines, scientific computing).

---

### ðŸ”¶ **4. Pattern Matching for `switch` (Final) â€“ JEP 433**

> Pattern matching for `switch` has been enhanced and is now fully stable, allowing more powerful and flexible matching.

- **Description:** Pattern matching improves how `switch` handles complex data types, including objects and records. This makes `switch` expressions more concise and expressive.

**Example:**

```java
static String match(Object obj) {
    return switch (obj) {
        case String s -> "String: " + s;
        case Integer i -> "Integer: " + i;
        default -> "Unknown";
    };
}
```

- **Use Case:** Simplify conditional logic, especially when working with complex objects and data types.

---

### ðŸ”¶ **5. Scoped Values (Incubator) â€“ JEP 427**

> Scoped values provide a lightweight mechanism for managing data that is scoped to a specific context or execution flow.

- **Description:** Scoped values are intended to provide a more flexible mechanism for passing and managing context-specific data (e.g., tracing, security contexts) without requiring global state.

**Example:**

```java
ScopedValue<Integer> scopedValue = ScopedValue.of(10);
scopedValue.run(() -> System.out.println("Scoped Value: " + scopedValue.get()));
```

- **Use Case:** Useful for managing temporary data that is context-sensitive, such as tracing information in a multi-threaded environment.

---

### ðŸ”¶ **6. Foreign Linker API (Incubator) â€“ JEP 442**

> This feature builds upon the Foreign Function & Memory API and aims to provide a more flexible API to bind to and invoke native functions.

- **Description:** The Foreign Linker API provides a way to link and call native functions dynamically from Java without using JNI, simplifying integration with C/C++ libraries.

**Example:**

```java
CLinker linker = CLinker.getInstance();
SymbolLookup lookup = CLinker.systemLookup();
FunctionDescriptor funcDesc = FunctionDescriptor.of(CLinker.C_INT, CLinker.C_POINTER);
MethodHandle methodHandle = lookup.lookup("nativeFunction").orElseThrow();
```

- **Use Case:** For applications that need dynamic function calls from C or other native libraries, like those in high-performance or systems programming.

---

### ðŸ”¶ **7. Project Loom - Thread-Local Handshakes (Final) â€“ JEP 451**

> Project Loom introduces a new mechanism for stopping threads more efficiently, improving thread-based operations.

- **Description:** This mechanism allows threads to be stopped safely without pausing the entire JVM, improving garbage collection and debugging performance.

- **Use Case:** Applications with high thread usage, especially in environments where pause times during GC need to be minimized.

---

### ðŸ”¶ **8. Performance Improvements**

- **Garbage Collection (G1/ZGC):** Improvements in G1 and ZGC collectors reduce latency and optimize memory management for large applications.
- **Memory Efficiency:** Enhancements in memory usage when working with virtual threads, minimizing overhead in high-concurrency applications.

---

### ðŸ”¶ **9. JDK Tooling Improvements**

- **JVM CI Compiler:** New JVMCI improvements provide more control over the JVM compiler, allowing users to customize compilation processes.
- **Enhanced Diagnostics:** Diagnostic tools in Java 21 offer better insights into JVM performance, memory usage, and garbage collection logs.

### âœ… **Migration Strategy for Java 21**

1. **Virtual Threads:** Move from traditional thread pools to virtual threads if your application requires high concurrency and has a low resource footprint.
2. **Pattern Matching:** Begin using pattern matching in `switch` and `instanceof` for more concise and expressive code.
3. **Scoped Values:** Start experimenting with scoped values for better context management, especially in multi-threaded applications.
4. **Foreign Function & Memory API:** If your project interacts with native libraries, consider adopting the Foreign Function & Memory API to avoid JNI.
