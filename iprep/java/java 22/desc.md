## âœ… **Java 22 (2024) â€“ Key Features and Enhancements**

### ðŸ”¶ **1. Record Patterns (Final) â€“ JEP 439**

> Record Patterns are further enhanced and now finalized, enabling even more powerful pattern matching for records and sealed types.

- **Description:** This feature improves `instanceof` and `switch` expressions, allowing destructuring of records directly within `instanceof` and `switch`.

**Example:**

```java
record Person(String name, int age) {}

static String match(Object obj) {
    return switch (obj) {
        case Person(String name, int age) -> "Person: " + name + " (" + age + ")";
        case String s -> "String: " + s;
        default -> "Unknown";
    };
}
```

- **Use Case:** Simplifies destructuring records and enhances readability in conditional logic, especially when using sealed or record types.

---

### ðŸ”¶ **2. Project Loom: Virtual Threads Enhancements â€“ JEP 457**

> Virtual Threads continue to be improved with optimizations in scheduling and resource management.

- **Description:** Virtual threads become more scalable with fewer resources and lower overhead, improving high-concurrency applications, especially in web servers and microservices architectures.

**Example:**

```java
Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("Running on Virtual Thread: " + Thread.currentThread());
Thread.startVirtualThread(task);
```

- **Use Case:** Suitable for applications that require thousands of threads with minimal memory consumption, such as highly concurrent servers.

---

### ðŸ”¶ **3. Structured Concurrency (Incubator) â€“ JEP 458**

> Structured Concurrency introduces a new API that simplifies working with multiple threads and tasks in a structured manner.

- **Description:** Structured concurrency provides a way to manage threads more easily and safely by introducing structured scopes for tasks.

**Example:**

```java
try (var scope = new StructuredExecutor()) {
    scope.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task 1"));
    scope.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task 2"));
}
```

- **Use Case:** Useful for simplifying concurrent programming by reducing the complexity of thread management, making the code more maintainable.

---

### ðŸ”¶ **4. Foreign Function & Memory API (Final) â€“ JEP 421**

> The Foreign Function and Memory API has been further improved to provide more safety and ease of use when interacting with native code.

- **Description:** Enhancements make it easier to access and manage off-heap memory and interact with native functions more safely, without needing to use JNI.

**Example:**

```java
try (var arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    var memorySegment = arena.allocate(100);
    memorySegment.set(0, (byte) 42);
    System.out.println(memorySegment.get(0)); // Accessing off-heap memory
}
```

- **Use Case:** Ideal for applications that need to interact with native code, such as performance-critical applications, game engines, and scientific computing.

---

### ðŸ”¶ **5. Project Panama: Native Linking Enhancements â€“ JEP 444**

> Enhancements to Project Panama provide better functionality and efficiency when calling native functions from Java.

- **Description:** The Native Linking API has been improved, allowing more seamless binding to native libraries and functions.

**Example:**

```java
CLinker linker = CLinker.getInstance();
SymbolLookup lookup = CLinker.systemLookup();
FunctionDescriptor funcDesc = FunctionDescriptor.of(CLinker.C_INT, CLinker.C_POINTER);
MethodHandle methodHandle = lookup.lookup("nativeFunction").orElseThrow();
```

- **Use Case:** For applications requiring interaction with C or other native libraries, providing a more efficient way to call native functions dynamically.

---

### ðŸ”¶ **6. Pattern Matching for Sealed Classes â€“ JEP 445**

> Pattern matching is now fully supported for sealed classes, allowing more flexible and concise handling of type hierarchies.

- **Description:** This feature enables pattern matching with sealed classes, making it easier to handle different cases in a type-safe and expressive manner.

**Example:**

```java
sealed interface Animal permits Dog, Cat {}

final class Dog implements Animal {}
final class Cat implements Animal {}

static void printAnimal(Animal animal) {
    switch (animal) {
        case Dog d -> System.out.println("Dog");
        case Cat c -> System.out.println("Cat");
        default -> System.out.println("Unknown animal");
    }
}
```

- **Use Case:** Helps simplify the code when working with sealed class hierarchies, enabling better type-safety and readability.

---

### ðŸ”¶ **7. New macOS Rendering Pipeline â€“ JEP 455**

> A new rendering pipeline optimized for macOS using the Metal API has been introduced to improve performance on Apple devices.

- **Description:** This pipeline uses the Metal API to provide better rendering performance on macOS devices, making graphical applications faster and more efficient on macOS.

**Example:**

- The new pipeline automatically uses Metal API when running on macOS, providing better performance for graphics-heavy Java applications.

- **Use Case:** Java applications with heavy graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that run on macOS can now perform better with this new pipeline.

---

### ðŸ”¶ **8. Code Snippets in Javadoc â€“ JEP 445**

> Javadoc is enhanced to support the inclusion of code snippets directly in the documentation.

- **Description:** This feature allows developers to embed code snippets in Javadoc comments, improving the usability of documentation and providing better examples for users.

**Example:**

```java
/**
 * This method adds two integers.
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * int result = add(1, 2);
 * </pre>
 */
public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

- **Use Case:** Helps document APIs with code examples, improving the quality of JavaDocs and making them more user-friendly.

---

### ðŸ”¶ **9. Garbage Collection (G1 and ZGC Enhancements) â€“ JEP 449**

> G1 and ZGC garbage collectors have received optimizations to further reduce latency and improve overall performance.

- **Description:** These improvements enhance the scalability and efficiency of garbage collection in applications that rely on low-latency requirements or large-scale memory management.

---

### ðŸ”¶ **10. Miscellaneous Performance and Memory Improvements**

- **Garbage Collection:** Improvements in both the G1 and ZGC collectors that reduce memory usage and improve throughput and latency.
- **JVM Performance:** Optimizations that improve the overall performance of JVM startup time, application execution, and memory management.
- **Security Improvements:** Enhanced security features, including stronger default cryptographic algorithms and improved secure coding practices.
