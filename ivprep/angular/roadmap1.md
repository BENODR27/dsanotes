  * Service Workers and PWA setup

### **Week 8: Security, Best Practices & Architecture**

* **Angular Security**

  * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention
  * Secure HTTP Calls and API security
  * Best practices for handling authentication (JWT, OAuth)
* **Modular Architecture & Best Practices**

  * Modularizing components, services, and feature modules
  * Scaling Angular apps: Lazy-loaded modules, Service Workers
