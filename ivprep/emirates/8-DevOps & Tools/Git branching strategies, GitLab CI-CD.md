Here's a **professional, senior-level guide** to Git branching strategies and GitLab CI/CD pipelines, tailored for enterprise-grade development.

## üöÄ PART 1: Git Branching Strategies (for Large-Scale Teams)

### 1. **Git Flow (Classic)**

- **Best For**: Teams with scheduled releases and hotfixes.
- **Key Branches**:

  - `main` ‚Äì production-ready code
  - `develop` ‚Äì ongoing integration
  - `feature/*` ‚Äì new features
  - `release/*` ‚Äì prep for release
  - `hotfix/*` ‚Äì urgent production fixes

> ‚úÖ Pros: Well-organized; supports stable releases
> ‚ùå Cons: Complex for fast-paced CI/CD

### 2. **GitHub Flow**

- **Best For**: Continuous deployment teams.
- **Workflow**:

  - Branch off from `main`
  - Use feature branches (`feature/login-api`)
  - Pull request ‚Üí Code review ‚Üí Merge to `main` ‚Üí Deploy

> ‚úÖ Pros: Lightweight, CD-friendly
> ‚ùå Cons: Lacks environment isolation

### 3. **GitLab Flow**

- **Best For**: GitLab CI/CD users who deploy to multiple environments.
- **Combines**: GitHub Flow + Environment branches
- **Structure**:

  - `main` ‚Äì production
  - `dev` ‚Äì development
  - `staging` ‚Äì pre-production
  - Feature branches ‚Üí Merged to `dev` ‚Üí CI/CD deploys to staging ‚Üí Merge to `main` ‚Üí deploys to production

> ‚úÖ Pros: Fits well with CI/CD
> ‚úÖ Built-in GitLab Environment support

## üîß PART 2: GitLab CI/CD - Senior-Level Pipeline Guide

### üß± .gitlab-ci.yml Overview

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - dockerize
  - deploy

variables:
  DOCKER_IMAGE: registry.gitlab.com/mygroup/myapp

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Compiling..."
    - mvn clean compile
  only:
    - dev

unit_tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."
    - mvn test

docker_build:
  stage: dockerize
  image: docker:latest
  services:
    - docker:dind
  script:
    - docker login -u $CI_REGISTRY_USER -p $CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD $CI_REGISTRY
    - docker build -t $DOCKER_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA .
    - docker push $DOCKER_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA
  only:
    - main
    - staging

deploy_staging:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - kubectl apply -f k8s/staging.yaml
  environment:
    name: staging
    url: https://staging.myapp.com
  only:
    - staging

deploy_prod:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - kubectl apply -f k8s/prod.yaml
  environment:
    name: production
    url: https://myapp.com
  only:
    - main
```

### üîç Key Concepts for Senior Roles

| Concept         | Description                                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stages**      | Logical grouping of jobs (build ‚Üí test ‚Üí deploy)           |
| **Jobs**        | Steps within a stage                                       |
| **Runners**     | Agents that execute jobs. Use GitLab-Hosted or Self-Hosted |
| **Artifacts**   | Persist files (e.g., `target/*.jar`) between jobs          |
| **Cache**       | Speed up builds (e.g., Maven `.m2/` folder)                |
| **Environment** | Named deployments (dev, staging, prod)                     |
| **Triggers**    | Conditional jobs (tags, branches, schedules)               |

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Features for Professionals

- **Secrets Management**: Use CI/CD variables for Docker credentials, API keys.
- **Manual Triggers (Approvals)**:

  ```yaml
  deploy_prod:
    stage: deploy
    when: manual
    script: ...
  ```

- **Matrix Builds**: Parallel testing (e.g., different Java versions)
- **Include Configs**: Reuse CI logic from `.gitlab-ci/includes/*.yml`

  ```yaml
  include:
    - local: "ci-templates/build.yml"
  ```

- **Auto DevOps**: GitLab's built-in CI/CD (can be customized)

### üß† Branch-to-Environment Mapping (Best Practice)

| Branch    | Environment | Pipeline Steps              |
| --------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| `dev`     | Development | Build + Unit Tests          |
| `staging` | Staging     | Full Test + Docker + Deploy |
| `main`    | Production  | Smoke Test + Deploy         |

---

## üß™ Sample Workflow

1. **Developer** pushes to `feature/login-api`
2. **Merge Request** to `dev` branch ‚Üí runs build + unit tests
3. **Merge to `staging`** ‚Üí triggers full CI + deploys to staging
4. **Manual QA** ‚Üí Merge to `main` ‚Üí triggers production deploy
