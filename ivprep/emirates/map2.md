Great question — looking at it from the **interviewer's perspective**, especially for a **Senior Technical Software Engineer** at a world-class organization like **Emirates Group IT**, there are a few **commonly overlooked but important areas** candidates often miss.

Here’s a refined and **complete list including those gaps**, divided by **interviewer expectations**:

---

## 🔍 **What Interviewers Expect — And Candidates Often Miss**

### 1. **System Design (HLD & LLD)**

✅ Covered earlier, but interviewers expect:

- **Trade-offs** (CAP theorem, consistency vs availability)
- **Scaling patterns** (horizontal vs vertical)
- **Caching strategies** (Redis, CDN, local caching)
- **Rate limiting**, retries, circuit breaker fallback

> **Pro tip:** Prepare to **whiteboard a design** like “Flight Booking System” or “Ticket Pricing Engine”.

---

### 2. **Code Quality & Refactoring**

📌 Interviewers check for:

- Clean Code principles (Uncle Bob style)
- Naming conventions, modular design
- Ability to spot and refactor bad code
- Recognizing code smells and applying design patterns

> **Ask yourself:** Can I justify each function name and class responsibility?

---

### 3. **Production-Readiness**

🎯 Interviewers may ask:

- How would you **monitor and log** this service?
- How would you **handle failure gracefully**?
- Where would you add **metrics** (e.g., Prometheus, AppDynamics)?
- How would you **rollback a bad release**?

> **Pro tip:** Know your way around **observability tools**: logs, traces, metrics.

---

### 4. **Security Knowledge (Often Ignored!)**

🔐 Interviewers expect:

- OWASP Top 10 (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection)
- Token validation (JWT structure, expiration)
- Secure headers (CSP, HSTS)
- Password storage (bcrypt, salting)

> **Bonus**: Mention **ShiftLeft**, **Snyk**, or **Veracode** if you've worked with them.

---

### 5. **CI/CD Deep Dive**

🔄 Not just what tools you use, but:

- How does your pipeline handle test failures?
- How do you do **zero-downtime deployment**?
- How would you automate **rollback**?
- Secret management (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault)

---

### 6. **Behavioral + Leadership Insights**

🧠 Senior roles = soft skills + team impact

- When did you **mentor juniors** or guide code reviews?
- How do you **disagree with a tech decision** professionally?
- How do you **handle tight deadlines** or scope creep?
- Examples of **taking ownership** or **driving improvement**?

---

### 7. **Agile Engineering Practices**

📋 Interviewers expect more than “I worked in Agile”

- Definition of Done
- Sprint planning, retrospectives, story pointing
- **Continuous feedback loops**
- **Pair programming**, **TDD**, **BDD**

---

### 8. **Business Thinking / Domain Knowledge**

💼 Emirates = Aviation + Logistics

- Do you understand how tech aligns with business?
- Can you model airline workflows like ticketing, fleet, crew scheduling, etc.?
- Can you ask good **domain-specific questions**?

> **Pro tip:** Mention awareness of aviation trends like IATA NDC, airline retailing, or Sabre/Amadeus if relevant.
