Okay, here's an expanded list of 50 common patterns for coding and DSA problems, going into more specific techniques and problem types within the broader categories:

**I. Array and String Manipulation Patterns:**

1.  **Two Pointers (Converging):** For problems like finding pairs with a specific sum, reversing arrays/strings, or merging sorted arrays.
2.  **Two Pointers (Diverging):** For problems where one pointer iterates through the array, and another helps maintain a condition (e.g., finding subarrays with certain properties).
3.  **Sliding Window (Fixed Size):** For finding maximum/minimum sum/average of a subarray of a given size.
4.  **Sliding Window (Variable Size):** For finding the shortest/longest subarray/substring that satisfies a given condition.
5.  **Prefix Sum:** Efficiently calculating the sum of subarrays. Useful for range sum queries.
6.  **Suffix Sum:** Similar to prefix sum, but calculated from the end.
7.  **Hashing for Frequency Counting:** Using hash maps to count occurrences of elements.
8.  **Hashing for Lookups:** Quickly checking the existence of elements or pairs.
9.  **Sorting for Comparison:** Pre-sorting the array to facilitate other operations (e.g., finding duplicates, applying two-pointer techniques).
10. **In-place Reversal:** Reversing an array or string without using extra space.
11. **Matrix Traversal (Spiral):** Iterating through a matrix in a spiral pattern.
12. **Matrix Traversal (Diagonal):** Iterating through diagonals of a matrix.
13. **String Matching (Basic):** Finding occurrences of a substring within a string.
14. **String Anagrams:** Identifying if two strings are anagrams of each other.
15. **Palindrome Check:** Determining if a string is a palindrome.

**II. Linked List Patterns:**

16. **Two Pointers (Fast & Slow):** Detecting cycles, finding the middle node, finding the k-th to last element.
17. **Dummy Node:** Simplifying operations at the head of the linked list (insertion, deletion).
18. **Reversing a Linked List (Iterative):** Reversing the links between nodes.
19. **Reversing a Linked List (Recursive):** Achieving reversal using recursion.
20. **Reversing a Sublist:** Reversing a specific portion of the linked list.
21. **Merging Two Sorted Lists:** Combining two sorted linked lists into one sorted list.
22. **Cycle Detection and Removal:** Identifying and breaking cycles in a linked list.

**III. Tree Patterns:**

23. **Depth-First Search (DFS) - Preorder Traversal:** Visiting the current node before its children.
24. **Depth-First Search (DFS) - Inorder Traversal:** Visiting the left child, then the current node, then the right child (for BSTs, it gives sorted order).
25. **Depth-First Search (DFS) - Postorder Traversal:** Visiting the children before the current node.
26. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) / Level Order Traversal:** Visiting nodes level by level.
27. **Tree Recursion (Divide and Conquer):** Solving tree problems by recursively solving subproblems for left and right subtrees.
28. **Binary Search Tree (BST) Search:** Efficiently finding a node in a BST.
29. **BST Insertion and Deletion:** Maintaining the BST property while adding or removing nodes.
30. **Tree Height and Depth Calculation:** Finding the maximum distance from the root to a leaf.
31. **Tree Diameter:** Finding the longest path between any two nodes in a tree.
32. **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA):** Finding the shared ancestor of two nodes that is farthest from the root.

**IV. Graph Patterns:**

33. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) for Graphs:** Finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs, level-order traversal.
34. **Depth-First Search (DFS) for Graphs:** Exploring connected components, detecting cycles.
35. **Adjacency List Representation:** Using lists to store neighbors of each node.
36. **Adjacency Matrix Representation:** Using a 2D array to represent edges.
37. **Cycle Detection (Directed Graph):** Identifying cycles in directed graphs (using visited and recursion stack).
38. **Cycle Detection (Undirected Graph):** Identifying cycles in undirected graphs.
39. **Topological Sort:** Ordering nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) based on dependencies.
40. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finding the shortest path in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.
41. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union):** Efficiently tracking connected components and detecting cycles.

**V. Dynamic Programming Patterns:**

42. **1D DP:** Problems where the solution for a state depends on the solution of previous single states (e.g., Fibonacci, climbing stairs).
43. **2D DP:** Problems where the solution for a state depends on the solution of neighboring states in a 2D grid (e.g., longest common subsequence, edit distance).
44. **Knapsack Problem Variations:** Solving optimization problems with constraints on weight and value.
45. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):** Finding the longest subsequence with increasing order.
46. **Matrix Chain Multiplication:** Optimizing the order of matrix multiplications.
47. **Memoization (Top-Down DP):** Using recursion with caching to avoid redundant calculations.
48. **Tabulation (Bottom-Up DP):** Building a DP table iteratively from base cases.

**VI. Backtracking Patterns:**

49. **Generating Permutations:** Finding all possible orderings of elements.
50. **Generating Combinations:** Finding all possible subsets of a given size.
51. **Subset Generation:** Finding all possible subsets of a set.
52. **Solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems:** (e.g., Sudoku, N-Queens).
53. **Pathfinding in a Maze:** Finding a path from a start to an end point.

**VII. Greedy Patterns:**

54. **Activity Selection:** Choosing the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.
55. **Fractional Knapsack:** Selecting fractions of items to maximize value within a weight limit.
56. **Interval Scheduling:** Problems involving scheduling intervals to maximize a certain objective.

**VIII. Bit Manipulation Patterns:**

57. **Checking if a bit is set.**
58. **Setting a specific bit.**
59. **Clearing a specific bit.**
60. **Toggling a specific bit.**
61. **Counting set bits.**
62. **Finding the single unique element in an array (using XOR).**
63. **Checking if a number is a power of 2.**
