You're right to think about patterns beyond the fundamentals for a professional level. At that stage, interviews often delve into more complex algorithms, system design aspects, and nuanced applications of core concepts. Here are some additional patterns and topics that are more relevant for professional-level coding and DSA interviews:

**I. Advanced Algorithm and Data Structure Patterns:**

1.  **Monotonic Stack/Queue:** Efficiently finding next greater/smaller elements, solving problems related to maximum/minimum in sliding windows with optimizations.
2.  **Segment Tree:** Efficiently handling range queries (sum, min, max) and updates on an array.
3.  **Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree):** Another efficient data structure for range queries and updates, often with a smaller constant factor than segment trees.
4.  **Trie (Prefix Tree):** Efficiently storing and searching for strings with common prefixes. Useful for autocomplete, dictionary problems, and IP routing.
5.  **Suffix Array and Suffix Tree:** Advanced data structures for string searching and pattern matching, used in bioinformatics and text processing.
6.  **Computational Geometry Basics:** Understanding concepts like points, lines, polygons, and basic algorithms like convex hull (conceptual understanding).
7.  **Network Flow Algorithms (e.g., Max Flow):** Solving problems involving capacities and flows in networks (conceptual understanding of Ford-Fulkerson).
8.  **Matching Algorithms (e.g., Bipartite Matching):** Solving problems involving matching elements from two sets.
9.  **Advanced Graph Algorithms:**
    * Strongly Connected Components (SCC)
    * Bridge and Articulation Point detection
10. **Randomized Algorithms:** Understanding the basics of algorithms that use randomness to achieve a result with a certain probability (e.g., quicksort with random pivot).
11. **Approximation Algorithms:** For NP-hard problems, understanding how to find solutions that are provably close to the optimal solution.

**II. Dynamic Programming (Advanced):**

12. **Bitmasking DP:** Using bitmasks to represent subsets or states in DP problems.
13. **Digit DP:** Solving counting problems based on the digits of a number.
14. **Tree DP (More Complex):** DP on tree structures involving subtree information.
15. **State Compression DP:** Reducing the state space of DP using clever representations.

**III. Concurrency and Parallelism Patterns (Crucial for Professional Roles):**

16. **Thread Safety and Synchronization:** Understanding and implementing thread-safe code using locks, semaphores, and other synchronization primitives.
17. **Deadlock Prevention and Detection:** Techniques to avoid or identify deadlocks in concurrent systems.
18. **Concurrency Utilities:** Familiarity with Java's `java.util.concurrent` package (e.g., thread pools, concurrent collections, atomic variables).
19. **Asynchronous Programming:** Understanding concepts like Futures, Promises, and reactive programming paradigms.
20. **Distributed Systems Concepts:** Basic understanding of distributed consensus (e.g., Paxos, Raft - conceptual), distributed locking, and data consistency in distributed environments.

**IV. System Design and Scalability (Essential for Professional Roles):**

21. **Caching Strategies (Advanced):** Understanding different cache eviction policies, write-through vs. write-back caches, and distributed caching patterns.
22. **Database Optimization:** Indexing strategies, query optimization, database sharding and replication.
23. **Message Queues and Asynchronous Communication:** Designing systems using message queues for decoupling and scalability.
24. **Load Balancing Techniques (Advanced):** Different load balancing algorithms, handling session stickiness.
25. **Microservices Architecture:** Understanding the principles and challenges of microservices.
26. **API Design Principles:** RESTful API design, versioning, rate limiting.
27. **Scalability Patterns:** Horizontal vs. vertical scaling, eventual consistency.
28. **Fault Tolerance and Resilience:** Designing systems that can handle failures gracefully.

**V. Object-Oriented Design (Advanced):**

29. **Design Patterns (Creational, Structural, Behavioral - In-depth):** Knowing when and how to apply various design patterns effectively.
30. **SOLID Principles (Deep Understanding and Application):** Designing maintainable and scalable software using these principles.
31. **Architectural Patterns (e.g., MVC, MVVM):** Understanding common architectural patterns and their trade-offs.

**VI. Testing (Beyond Basic Unit Tests):**

32. **Integration Testing Strategies:** Testing the interaction between different components.
33. **End-to-End Testing:** Testing the entire system flow.
34. **Performance Testing and Profiling:** Identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks.

**VII. Problem-Solving Approaches (Professional Level):**

35. **Breaking Down Complex Problems:** Ability to decompose large, ambiguous problems into smaller, manageable parts.
36. **Identifying Bottlenecks and Optimizations:** Thinking critically about time and space complexity and identifying areas for improvement.
37. **Considering Edge Cases and Constraints Thoroughly:** Not just solving the happy path but also handling unusual or extreme inputs.
38. **Communicating Solutions Clearly and Concisely:** Explaining your thought process and trade-offs effectively.
39. **Thinking About Trade-offs:** Recognizing that different solutions have different advantages and disadvantages (time vs. space, complexity vs. maintainability).

Remember that at a professional level, it's not just about knowing the algorithms and data structures, but also about understanding when and why to use them, and how they fit into larger system designs. Demonstrating a strong understanding of trade-offs, scalability, and robustness is key.
